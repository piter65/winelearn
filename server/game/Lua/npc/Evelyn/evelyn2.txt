Welcome to New City! \n\n I am so happy your school is helping out! \n\n My name is Evelyn Hu, and I'm the office assistant here at Professional Services, Inc. \n\nI want to thank your teacher and school for participating in the this prototype. \n\n It is going to be much different than the regular game, and should take about 10 minutes. Before we get started, please move your mouse over a response choice below, and left-click.","VS_WOT1_01.wav"},--audio

	{"ns","I'm guessing you're already familiar with the basic controls, so let's get right to business.  We'll be using the journal to keep notes.  The designers of this game will be reading your journal, so, just like the real world, don't write down something you do not want others to see! \n\n Open your Journal, go to the notes section, and type '#1'","VS_WOT1_02.wav"},--audio
	{"p","Okay.  I've typed '#1' into my journal."},
	
	{"ns","Great!  Throughout this pilot, we'll ask you to enter things in your journal, usually with a number.  Now, next to #1, type in your school name, team name, and your player id at the top.  It should look something like this:\n\n#1.George Washington Schoool\nThe Fuzzy Bunnies\nDave8","VS_WOT1_02.wav"},--audio
	{"p","Okay.  I've enterred that into info my journal."},



	
	{"ns","Now, start a new line, enter #2.  Type in the type of computer you are on, and what browser. \n\n For example, if on a Windows system, in Chrome, type \n'#2. Windows 10, Chrome.'\n\n   or you may enter \n\n '#2. Mac   Safari'\n\n\n   If you do not know exactly, it is ok.  Make your best guess.","VS_WOT1_02.wav"},--audio

	{"ns","Great.  One last thing.  Can you test the right mouse button?  It is supposed to move the camera around.  Does it work for you? \n\n type '#3' in your journal, and write if the mouse works or does not work.","VS_WOT1_04.wav"},--audio

	{"ns","Great!  Thanks for helping.  The game designers will ll be checking your journal to see your results.  Try to keep it clean, and readable.  It's ok to add comments, or things you notice, anything that you think the designers should know.  Keep in mind, the game is not finished, and there will be problems.","VS_WOT1_05.wav"},--audio
