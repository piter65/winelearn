    	Narravi Associates Disappoints!
    
    	Despite their successful PR work, the Elliot County Media Professionals’ Association has singled out Narravi Associates -  for finishing in dead last place in the Media Professionals’’ softball league. Setting records for wild pitches and umpires- injured-by-errant-throws, the team looks forward to winning a game for the first time in club history, next season. “Their team captain and Narravi’s President, Nina Ojeda has a talented team of information experts that specialize in encapsulating critical data into effective communication,” said one umpire. “But they couldn’t hit the broadside of a barn with a softball, that’s for sure.” Others are not so happy with Ojeda’s performance, either.  “She sure is controlling.  She really tried the umpires’ patience – and the other team – with her manipulative tactics.” The loss comes as Narravi spent its customary $1200 for posters around town promoting the team. “Oh, well,” said Narravi. “At least our abysmal performance will make headlines.”
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    	Area Media Relations Firm “Too Busy”
    
    	Normally, PR powerhouse Nina Ojeda would never turn down an interview. As the president of Navari Associates, Ojeda is constantly seeking attention for her clients. So why the sudden drop-off in returned calls? “Busy. All good. Talk soon!” is the only statement Ojeda is willing to make.  Mort Steinbeck, the building’s window washer, reports a 24x7 beehive of activity at the media relations firm. “They’re at it all the time tapping on them there computers – and eating, of course – they’re like pigs with a work ethic!” It’s widely known that Navari bills its clients $500 for take out food and office parties for the duration of a contract. While that explains the food, why the recent flurry of activity? “Scandalmania,” admits business watchdog Jake Fang. “Top companies in New City and around the state have been hit hard in the news - now Navari is snapping up all the lucrative business.” That’s left many smaller clients and public service groups out in the cold. “No matter what she says,” admits Fang, “Ojeda has never cared that much for charity work.”  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    	New Developments Heard Through Gabe Vine!
    
    	Is beautiful Tamiroff Park about to become the backyard for the rich and famous?  According to Gabe Vine of New Media Communications, the answer is yes. “Well, I really can’t say,” explained Vine after a closed door meeting at the state house, “but my new client, BluCo Construction, will absolutely build 18 huge, luxury compound-style homes on a strip of private land that cuts way into the state park. In fact we just signed the papers and construction begins July 10th.” This startling admission is sure to cause outrage in the community who cherish the park as a natural oasis in the city. And it is an inauspicious start to Vine’s PR relationship with BluCo. “Normally you want to quell controversy in these situations,” said business watchdog, Jake Fang, ‘but Gabe Vine just ignited one.” While a respected local agency, NMC has had trouble in the past handling negative press situations. After another brief closed door meeting, Vine explained that he will set up an on site “war room” next to BluCo’s offices – at a cost of $2000 – to react quickly to any public outcry. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    	Norse Fails to Steer Tricon out of Spotlight
    
    	It just doesn’t add up.  When an accounting scandal ignited at Trifon Enterprises – a large regional cable television provider that spans five states – it hired PR powerhouse Norse Communications to quell the media firestorm.  Instead, Norse fanned the flames of negative press and the company has now filed for bankruptcy. What went wrong? “We hired Norse Communications because they specialize in handling large, interstate clients in high profile cases,” says Trifon CEO Abe Delfia, “But they just had no tact when dealing with the media.” The president of Norse’s local affiliate, Bjorn Egan, disagrees, “Our response was accurate, efficient and mathematically sound.” Norse’s response involved spending $1250 to fly in their accounting experts from around the state to deal with the situation. But their brutal honesty about the scale of the accounting fiasco alarmed investors instead of calming them down. “When the scandal broke I figured – heck, someone raided the kitty for a couple million, no big deal,” explained one very wealthy investor, “But when Norse spokesman showed the real math on TV, I sold my stock fast!”
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Area Press Relations Guru 'Tells it Like it Is’
    
    	Having “explosive diarrhea” isn’t something you want to announce to the world, but that’s exactly how Media Relations Inc. (MRI) president Marvin Moneymaker described why star pitcher Tom Fry wasn’t available for last night’s playoff game. When Moneymaker was asked why he couldn’t be a bit more delicate about the reason for Fry’s absence, he exclaimed, “Are you kidding?  You wouldn’t believe the mess!” The embarrassment for Fry continued when Moneymaker sent his staff of door-to-door salesmen to media outlets with flyers that illustrated the eruption with the caption, “Thar she blows!” Fry, who is not available for comment, is rumored to be angry about the $1000 cost of spreading around the word of his condition. The whole episode may indeed backfire for Moneymaker whose tremendous success in the media industry could be in jeopardy. “This could lose us the championship,” cried the New City Neutron’s manager Pete Shell, “Fry won’t come out of the clubhouse.” But Moneymaker doesn’t seem worried. He even plans to expand his PR firm – which exclusively services Elliot County - statewide.  “I just call ‘em like I see ‘em.” Moneymaker says.   
    
    
    
    


	Local Emergency Response Firm Poised for Growth	
	
  	Maxed out, overworked and chronically disorganized, New City Emergency Medics Association is set to grow. “Who knows more about stressful situations than we do?” asks NCEM director Gil Fermin, “We live on stress – literally.” While some question its bizarre methods, no one can deny that NCEM provides excellent emergency response services thanks to its up-to-date, high tech facilities and expert staff that knows how to manage the aftermath of a disaster. “Oh, they know what they’re doing alright,” says satisfied fire victim Mort Tiffied, “They control crowds and save lives- they’re even pretty good dancers.” NCEM typically charges $1800 for emergency equipment rental and to set up a security perimeter, which is higher than some other providers. “When disaster strikes, you don’t shop around for the lowest price – you want the best people and best equipment,” explains Fermin. He may be right – 8 out of 10 unlucky people say they’d choose NCEM the next time their lives go horribly wrong.  “We’re ready for growth,” says Fermin, “Bring it on!”
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Local Provider declared a "Model Emergency Services Firm”
	
	They’re rested, ready and well fed. The staff at First Responders is highly regarded as the best trained and most up-to-date of any emergency services provider in New City. It’s all thanks to owner John Gray whose years of working in the world class Rosenfield trauma ward have shown him how to keep his staff ready and motivated. It begins with barbeques. “We do a lot of team building through cookouts,” explains Gray, “It teaches cooperation, efficiency and burn treatment.” The techniques have paid off.  First Responders team is able to respond to emergencies in record time. They also pride themselves on keeping current with latest emergency response and rescue techniques. “We discovered a much more effective Heimlich maneuver,” claims Grey, “Which only requires two fingers.” Grey also keeps his staff loose by hiring massage therapists – at a cost of $500 – to provide deep tissue massage and facial treatments. “You can’t handle a stressful situation if you’re already stressed out,” says Grey. “Our guys know how to kick back and kick butt.”   
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Supermarket Opening A Success, Despite Hitch
	
	“Clowns are dangerous, destructive and evil,” stated former sheriff Sam Shortback who was on hand for the official opening of the Whole Paycheck supermarket in downtown New City. His anti-prankster announcement came as yet another area event was spoiled by a felonious fool. “The ribbon cutting was just underway,” explains store manager Wier Organic, “when we noticed the clown lighting heritage New Zealand kiwis on fire for juggling.” Soon, the entire produce section was ablaze. That’s when emergency response expert Medic! Inc. arrived on the scene. “We could smell the smoking fruit from our HQ,” recalls Medic! Inc. owner, Tom Barrier, “I knew that smell very well from my tour of duty in Panama.” Barrier’s mobilized his fully licensed and experienced team to the supermarket – at a cost of $1250 – and quickly extinguished the flames. But his security officers couldn’t stop the crowd from feasting on all the roasted fruit and vegetables that littered the aisles. “Since Medic! Inc. couldn’t stop the throng of hungry shoppers,” says Organic, “we turned the whole opening into an impromptu luau!” Clowns may be evil, but this time the lovers of all natural foods got the last laugh.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  	Local Hero to the Rescue!
	
	When the popcorn factory exploded in downtown New City on Tuesday, many workers were trapped inside - unable to escape a delicious smelling, puffy prison. “No one could eat their way out, and we couldn’t eat our way in,” recalls factory owner Red Orvillebacher. That’s when Mullen Medical Supply owner, Dr. Zeke Mullen came to the rescue. “Of course, I remember the great popcorn disaster of 1943,” says Dr. Mullen, “So I knew just what to do.” Dr. Mullen normally charges $1000 to deploy his medical and security detail in case of an emergency, but this time it wasn’t needed – he tackled the problem himself. Knowing that popcorn dissolves in water, Dr. Mullen activated the building’s sprinkler system which turned the confining corn into malleable mush. “It was a miracle,” exclaimed one grateful escapee, “Dr. Mullen should be given the key to the city!” In fact, he already has one for his years of service at New City Community Hospital. When asked why Dr. Mullen didn’t call his medical and security team for backup, he replied, “It was their nap-time – and they’re so old, they’re not really much help anyway.”
    
    
    
	Local Man Obsessive About Containment!
	
  	Walk into Peter Boltright’s machine shop in New City, and you enter a steampunk toy store wonderland. The owner of Premier Containment, Boltright is constantly inventing new, imaginative machines to contain toxic spills. There are robotic crabs, mechanized whirligigs and tanks made out of clear aluminum. With each new job, Boltright spends $500 on drafting supplies, prototyping materials and renting a 3D printer to bring his creations to life. “Every spill is a unique engineering challenge,” says the grease covered Boltright, “So I spend every waking moment tinkering with unique solutions.” “There’s a word for that,” explains industry analyst Nombe Lever, “Crazy.” Boltright’s mechanical obsession was on public display recently, when he was seen inappropriately fondling a next generation oil dredger at an industry tradeshow. But a subsequent psychological profile of Boltright shows that while he’s eccentric and obsessive, he’s pretty much sane. “When insanity is useful,” says New City psychiatrist Dianne Osis, “We call it ‘inspiration’. Boltright appears to be just very, very dedicated to his job. In the DSM IV he’d be considered, 'Alarmingly Dedicated'.” And that’s a good thing if you ask the thousands of people who have benefited over the years from his containment compulsion.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Elliot County Containment Vendor Still Foreign to Local Disasters
	
	Who is Oroko Nakashima and what is she doing here? Those are the two questions that seem to plague this toxic spill containment specialist every time her name crops up in the media. “She’s an enigma, a riddle,” says environmentalist Tom Post, “She’s like a riddily enigma pie covered in shadowy deceptive frosting.” This seems like harsh, delicious criticism for someone who is world renowned for her expertise in containing ocean spills and other environmental disasters. Her ability to mobilize local fishermen and conservationists to aid in cleanups – at a cost of $1200 – not only provides quick response time but transfers valuable skills to native populations. And Nakashima’s teaching at New City Community College has made its environmental conservation program the best in the state. So why is she so vilified by local groups? “She’s never here!” complains Post, “Every time there’s a disaster in what’s supposed to be her ‘hometown’, she’s off globetrotting to save a bunch of foreigners!” Could it be jealousy? Could it be xenophobia? Could it be concern over Nakashima’s lack of experience with local government officials and river cleanup? Whatever the reason, her global celebrity status has not added up to a lot of good will here in New City.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Vendor Credits Logistics Know-How for Successes
	
	“Everything that’s true about the U.S. Marines is true about us,” claims Phil Burell of Burell Brothers, the local hazardous waste cleanup firm that is run like a military outfit. Founders Phil and Bill leverage their past as Marines to create a unique corporate culture that is more Semper Fi than suit-and-tie. And the culture extends into their tactical approach to clean up, which conducts deployments modeled after the great Marine assaults of the past. Assault is the right word. The firm is known for shock-and-awe tactics that include beach landings, paratrooper drops and lots of apparently gratuitous explosions. Theirs is a strategy that requires boots on the ground, boots worn by friends in military service and state militias that they often mobilize at a cost of $1250. While some question their tactics, a string of successes confirm that the brothers are highly educated in the logistics and practices of spill containment in a variety of settings, though advocates for New City River point out their lack of experience with rivers. “We’re successful because we see waste as the enemy,” Bill explains. “We throw all our logistical know-how and firepower at spills and leaks like these things personally insulted our mothers.”
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Charity Darts Tournament Declared a Success!
	
	Who knew that a game of darts could do so much to save the world? Anthony Wexler, founder of Interstate Containment, that’s who. His charity darts tournament, “Have a Heart, Throw a Dart,” surpassed fundraising projections this weekend, prompting Wexler to declare the event an unqualified success. “A lot of people think darts is something to do when you’ve got nothing else to do,” Wexler commented. “But it can save us all!” The several thousands of dollars generated by the event will be donated to environmental groups. Not a bad investment for a function that cost $500 for dartboards, extra felt, darts, tips and a bouncer detail to ensure order. Many agree that the donations can make a difference, including the Green Rivers Alliance who honored Wexler with their annual Guys Who Gives A Damn award for his charity efforts. The award acknowledges the events Wexler organized as well as his recent donation of tournament prize money to a number of environmental charities—money won with a lucky shot that hit the its mark after bouncing off the artificially enhanced breast of a spectator. “This, more so than his actual waste containment company, is how Wexler contributes,” said the Alliance’s Drew Ablanc, “given that he has extremely odd, out-of-date equipment and no clue how contain spills or prevent contamination.” 
    
    
    
    
    
	Eco-Tech Sends Message to City of Wexlerberg 
	
	Who you gonna call, Wexlerburg? If you’re looking for someone to test your waterways for toxic leaks, hazardous wastebuster Nathaniel Wailer claims to be waiting by the phone. This comes as somewhat surprising news, given the expert’s reputation for being overworked and in constant demand. “Rumors of my unavailability are greatly exaggerated, mon,” Wailer tells us, with all the charm built into his Island accent. Should Wexlerburg make that call, they would appear to be in good hands. Wailer has built a solid track record of accuracy and is known to be free of biases.. Inspiring and well-spoken, he delivers his findings in a clear and concise manner. Costs are reasonable since—at a cost of $1800—he rents the monitoring devices he needs to measure and report ecological damage and environmental contamination. His numerous successes in the area speak loudly for his qualifications. But how can this go-to guy be available for Wexlerburg? Perhaps the answer has something to do with his tendency to fly in a team of experts from his island homeland of Montoga. Often arriving by helicopter, they amount to a veritable A-team of ecological experts. Upbeat and spirited, they’ve been known to tackle the ugliest of toxic spills with an optimism and display of cheer that some have called “practically supernatural”. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Monitoring Equipment Fails Local Vendor
	
	The numbers were off. Way off. According to the environmental assessment reports filed by the consultancy of Ypoforo Ecosystems in which toxicity levels suggested the river was a cocktail of battery acid, anti-freeze and runoff from a nuclear plant,. Yet, it didn’t take a high-profile environmental consultant to suspect the findings were inaccurate. After all, anyone could see that fish were still swimming. Frogs and tadpoles thrived along the banks. And human swimmers emerged from the water with their skin largely intact. All good indicators. So what went wrong with the assessment? Jannis Economou, the famous founder of Ypoforo, has suggested that the equipment he used could have been wrongly calibrated and, as a result, gave inaccurate readings. Many experts, however, question this explanation. After all, Ypoforo is known to have up-to-date training and equipment. Instead, many feel the more likely scenario is that Economou himself misread the numbers, due to his purportedly failing eyesight. New City Councilman Pat Down points to a line item that has recently appeared on Ypoforo’s invoices, charging $500 for eyeglasses, magnification lenses, large-print levels, and other aids Economou apparently needs to be able to see the small-size LED readouts on his monitoring equipment. Economou has offered to re-assess the waterway free of charge. “It’s the least he can do,” Down stated. “I’m sure his last report caused everyone in the river at the time to lose control of their bowels which, come to think of it, may throw off his new assessment.”
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Report Delivered During Candlelight Vigil
	
	Anyone interested in hearing environmental assessment findings by area advocate Ramblin’ Rose last Saturday may have come for the stats on Hurley Marsh, but stayed for the mellow—whether they like it or not. Rose, a former follower of the 90’s jam band The Boys, has her own unique way of disseminating her findings. For this occasion, she chose to hold the press conference at the site of a candlelight vigil commemorating the anniversary of the death of Jimmy Rodriguez, the legendary guitarist for The Boys. Incense, Boys bootleg tapes and unnaturally tasty brownies were distributed beside Rose’s chartered bus, which was used to bring in her team of volunteers to assist with the assessment at a cost of $1250. Rose has an enormous network of supporters and Boys fans she can call on to staff assessment teams. After performing a 20-minute air guitar solo tribute to Rodriguez, Rose attempted to psychically communicate her findings to area reporters. Despite her urgings, reporters failed to “open their minds” and “listen with their most authentic selves,” and Rose was forced to deliver the information more conventionally—that is, with words. It’s widely known that, despite her reputation as an unbiased and scrupulous assessor, Rose is an eccentric who has difficulty communicating her finds in a credible manner. This proved to be the case once again, when Rose summarized her report by saying the state of the Marsh gave her a “heck of a soul ache.”   
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	Scathing Report Condemns Local Factory
	
  	“Make “em pay,” is the slogan of the environmental consultancy Enviro-X, lead by local legend Skeeter McBragg. And that’s exactly what he intends to do to Plasticorp, whose chemical storage facility recently exploded. “They’re the worst,” McBragg proclaimed at a recent press conference, upon announcing that his group will lead the effort to assess the degree of toxicity released into the environment by the explosion. “They make me burn up,” he added, before distributing a report that was “written” with a Sharpie on napkins from Burrito Bill’s. The group has already set up a command center, complete with half-pipe, and members can be seen patrolling the area on their controversial motorized skateboards, which reportedly cost $500 to retrofit with 130 HP engines. Some locals find their presence alarming and are eager to point out that the Plasticorp explosion has all the characteristics of other eco-terror attacks that Enviro-X has been hired to assess. “It’s their fault,” said one of McBragg’s skate buddies and close coworker, when questioned about the incidents. “They had it coming to them…” Now fully entrenched, McBragg and his skater assessors seem determined to expose Plasticorp as disreputable corporate citizens, even as McBragg’s critics claim Enviro-X is better suited for creating environmental havoc that it is for assessing ecological damage. “Some critics need a good head-butt,” McBragg says in response, before laughing hysterically.

	Berlin Bullies Baddies
	
	After the recent oil spill on the New City River, oil company rent-a-cops probably rolled their eyes when the call came in: some celebrity spokesperson was using the company gates as a backdrop for a charity concert. As they holstered their Tasers and took up their billy clubs, they probably entertained visions of a wispy folksinger and her audience of flower-wielding peaceniks. Ho hum. How could they have known that the call referred to Wes Berlin, his legendary punk band Shrapnel, and hundreds of loyal fans? They found out soon enough, upon arriving at the scene where Shrapnel was pounding through a blistering set under a banner that read “Save the New City River!” As the security team moved in, they were quickly surrounded by the audience and slam-danced into submission. Some personnel were hoisted overhead, crowd-surfed against their will to the stage where Berlin was waiting to administer a spanking with a cricket paddle. The fans cheered each stroke and with each swing of the bat Berlin’s popularity seemed to climb another rung of the popularity ladder. Despite his tough appearance and aggressive tactics, the punk legend has proven to be well-spoken and witty, able to confidently handle himself in situations calling for improvisation. His effectiveness overrides his expenses, which includes a $4150 fee for microphones, PA speakers, cabling and instruments for the band. And who else can get away with literally spanking the anti-environmental forces of the world? 








	Hip-Hop Innovator to Collaborate with Symphony 

	To raise awareness for No Violin Left Behind, a charity that provides musical instruments to school’s serving underprivileged communities, hip-hop hero Grandmaster G will work with the New City Symphony to produce a charity event this spring. The concert will feature Grandmaster G’s greatest hits with orchestral arrangements. The popular hip-hop luminary will front the world-renowned orchestra, rapping his sometimes-controversial lyrics to a beat provided by timpani and snare, as well as melodies re-configured for strings and brass. Said Symphony conductor and maestro, Will Godeff, “Mr. G’s work is certainly…interesting. I look forward finding the music in it.” Grandmaster G shares the highly-trained, classically-minded maestros enthusiasm, stating, “Classical music needs to get on board, specially for a good cause like this.” Active on behalf of multiple charities, Grandmaster G says this one is particularly close to his heart. “Music saved my life and all because they gave us plastic recorders to play at school. I was the first kid to play hip-hop on that thing. The rest is history, feel me, yo?” To demonstrate his commitment, G has waived all of his usual fees, including the usual $2000 fee for his posse, which provides moral support and personal security services. “Don’t need a posse for an event like this,” explains G. “Ain’t no one going to be there but a bunch of old white people, and they’re only dangerous when they hold public office, know what I’m saying?”  









	Rudd a Dud as Spokesperson

	The reviews are in on country star Fiona Rudd. Not for any recent musical effort—after all, Rudd hasn’t released an album since the 70’s. Instead, Rudd is being critiqued as a relief and recovery spokesperson and the reviews aren’t good. This time around, her reviewers are environmental advocates and city officials, not music critics. Yet, the language is strikingly similar to Fiona’s final albums, which most agree represent the low point in her career. Said one advocate, “She’s soulless and clueless. Whatever understanding she once had of harmony is now lost.” Another gave this concise critique: “All filler, no killer.” And yet another advocated noted, “Fiona couldn’t spokesperson her way out of a paper bag.” Many blame her lack of depth and intellect, claiming she has neither the education nor skills to understand anything technical or complicated. Others point to her $2000 speaker and entertainer fees as proof of her cynical perspective on environmental causes. “She’s just in it for the money,” claims Tess Teng, a disappointed former fan. “That’s what happened with the music, too. She’s sold out.” Rudd has declined to comment on the “sell out” accusation, opting instead to let her music speak for her by directing reporters to one of her older b-sides, which is only available through an online music service, at a cost of $2 per download. 









	Wong’s “Multi-Taskers” Brings Readers to Task

	Another Phoenix Services Group (PSG) employee was committed to the psychiatric ward at Goodness Gracious Mental Hospital yesterday afternoon after being picked up by authorities for disturbing the peace. Twenty-one-year old intern Anthony “Sweet Meat” Nichols walked out of the offices of PSG after only three weeks under the employ of senior proprietor Margaret Wong. Wong, whose PSG is known as one of the top logistics firms in the nation and supplies transportation of relief supplies and restoration equipment, is said to be passive aggressive and controlling to the point that many an employee suffers a nervous breakdown. Case and point, only twenty days after Wong’s $1,000 company orientation, new hire Nichols, known by his co-workers as “the sweetest kid you’d ever want to meet,” hence ‘sweet meat,’ exited PSG offices and drifted into Asiatown. Witnesses heard him state repeatedly, “Mr. Insert Name Here is unavailable at the present moment, should you like to leave a voice message, kindly do so after the tone, and one of our dynamic representatives will return your call as soon as possible.” Ironically, the latter quote is the first sentence of chapter fifty-seven: Phone Etiquette, in Wong’s fifteen-hundred-page company manual, which all PSG employees are required to memorize verbatim. Nichols is currently under heavy sedation and is being observed by Dr. Christoph Mindheim of Berlin, who’s non-fiction study of Margaret Wong’s afflicted employees, ‘What’s Wong with My Noggin,” is forthcoming from Palpitation Press. 









	Shortback Brings in the Big Guns 

	He’s proven he possesses a network of freight train operators and rail line contacts to ensure adequate transportaion of supplies and equipment, but can Sam Shortback and his Prairie Fire Logistics firm shake the law enforcement ethos that seems to accompany him on deliveries and through town en route to the warehouses and various drop-off points? Just ask local gas station attendant Rusty Nozzle, who’s filled up the Prairie Logistics trucks twice this week while Shortback and his team of off-duty officers demanded more speed. “It’s seemed like they were rushing to a crime scene rather than delivering supplies,” Nozzle said, “Shortback kept yelling, ‘Move! Move! Move!’ and I says, ‘I can’t make the pump go any faster, sir,’ and he said back to me, ‘How would you like to me to arrest you for disobeying the order of a police officer,’ and I said, ‘I guess I wouldn’t like that much at all.’” Shortback, whose organization skills are largely credited for the reduction in crime in New City during his tenure as Sheriff, has dropped $2,000 in payments to freight train operators to guarantee adequate transportation and seems to be running a smooth operation. However, the retired New City sheriff himself has claimed that he’s gown weary from the lack of action he sees. “I suppose an old man like me gets carried away sometimes. I’m just an elder cowboy trying not to fall out of my saddle.”








	Shortback’s Cattle Call

	Ex-rodeo star turned professional logistics coordinator Dave Shortback needs local ranchers and cowboys to help support disaster relief. His Western Logistics firm apparently has $4,000 set aside for staffing. Western, whose network of transportation consists of horse and wagon technology, says they’re looking to redefine the industry and return to an era where logistics and transportation was more about community, country and enjoying the opportunity to traverse through the open prairie. However, sources claim this is a bunch of “malarkey,” saying the real reason has nothing to do with nostalgia or old-time values, but from a lack of access to railways due to the efforts of Shortback’s brother, Sam Shortback, to derail Western Logistics, so to speak. Malarkey or not, ranch hands, cowboys and farmers throughout Elliot County are signing up left and right for the next drive of supplies to support relief efforts in New City, not so much from a desire to aid in the clean-up it seems, but for an opportunity to ride with one of their local heroes. Nevertheless, Dave Shortback remains enthusiastic as ever about his latest venture. When asked if it was true that he aimed to make Western Logistics the finest logistics provider in New City, Shortback started jumping on the sofa in his office, lassoed this reporter, and screamed “Yeeeehaw!”









	New City Company Cleans Up a Clean Up

	When the Malarkey River in Rosenfield turned bright pink last month, the town council sprang into action. “We shut down the pig waste factory, cancelled the children’s river swim-a-thon and sent in a toxic waste clean up crew,” recalls Councilman Redda Larm. But the “toxic clean up crew” they used was just a few teenagers Rosenfield employs to scrub the local swimming pools. Soon, the river was a corrosive stew of chlorine, ammonia, lye soap and pig waste. With citizens in an uproar, the council hired Clean Green Machinery – an industry leader in safe and environmentally friendly hazardous waste disposal – from New City. “The animal runoff wasn’t so bad,” explains Ashley Dapper, senior partner of CGM, “It was the spectacularly bad first clean up attempt that posed the real challenge.” CGM immediately rented $4150 worth of berms, pallets and booms from an out of state manufacturer to contain the bleach scented filth. Once contained, Dapper and her team expertly extracted all the contaminants using solar powered vacuums. “We were able to separate all the different foreign substances with a wind-powered centrifuge,” says Dapper, “Then we processed the pig excrement with a portable wetland system. The other chemicals, like the chlorine, are headed back to the municipal pools.” With the clean up all cleaned up, Rosenfield has decided to reinstate the children’s river swim-a-thon. “We want to celebrate the great job we all did,” smiles Councilman Larm, “We fixed two environmental disasters in one week!”








	Biggest Is Best for Fuller West

	Fuller West’s waste disposal business is so big it probably affects the tides. At least that’s how it seems. Whether it’s his constant late-night TV ads where he shouts the word “HUGE!” or his rumbling army of dump trucks, drivers and foreman that supervise disposal efforts – at a cost of $2000 per job – West’s company is only short on one thing – subtlety. “It’s weird to see that guy’s big head everywhere,” says local organ grinder Groovy Gary, “Billboards, busses, dump trucks – look, he’s even put a sticker of his face on my monkey!” But West’s saturation approach has earned him the longest list of waste disposal clients in Elliot County, a list that includes some huge exclusive contracts: six cities, fourteen towns, an oil refinery and a laxative manufacturer - just to name a few. “I’m not successful just ‘cause I’m famous,” claims West, “people come for the name recognition – but they stay for the great service.” West does boast one of the most impressive arrays of recovery equipment around – making him one of the few specialists that can handle virtually any kind of spill. But being big does have its challenges. “You try sneaking into a movie theatre – or grabbing an extra pickle at a deli counter,” complains West, “immediately somebody’s always like, ‘Hey it’s that garbage guy!’ and you’re caught.” Luckily for West, his business is doing so well, he can probably pay for that movie ticket or second pickle. That’s one more reason it’s nice to be “HUUUUUUUUGE!”









	ADAM BAUM: ECO-SAINT OR RECKLESS SINNER? 

	Adam Baum is a conservationist. He is an experienced outdoorsman. He is a warrior in the fight to save the Earth from its thoughtless inhabitants. Thousands affirm that Baum is those things. But some, like scientist Dom Neuital, say he is reckless and cares little for those who work with him and for him. Baum responds, “I buy and design the most effective tools possible. His eco-friendly equipment is expensive, $4,000 for recent purchases, but is “eco-designed” specifically for Baum’s approach to toxic waste recovery. “I plan every recovery effort. My company bears the greatest expenses transporting volunteers to and from sites where their help is desperately needed,” the ecologist said. I recently doled out $2,000 for transport bills. Some say that Baum is not entirely ethical. That he takes advantage of resources that he is not entitled to such as convicts from the state prison system. Many of his volunteer workers offer “blind obedience” to the man and his company. The controversial  ecologist continues his work despite criticism. “Mother Earth deserves help with the burden of humanity making unreasonable demands of her. 









	EASTERN LEGAL EXPANSION CONTINUES

	Avanish Singh announced today that the expansion for his surprisingly successful firm continues. Eastern Legal Services will add members to its staff to meet the demand for low-cost representation in the area of environmental law. The firm is budgeting as much as $4,150 for hiring more staff and training interns. Eastern Legal has become a voice to be reckoned with in New City and Elliot County. “My father was a gargantuan influence on the elaboration of my intentionality,” said Singh, “He embroidered his ethnicity, entwined his embrace of the American Dream. My work is a continuation of that elaboration.” The firm is searching for employees who can focus on research and details, the areas that Singh is a noted master of. “Avanish cannot be the sole carrier of law and legal precedents. We need some more brain-power in this office,” said Butch Wachers, an Eastern Legal associate. Singh has announced plans to sue the New City Water Commission for “failing to meet the required standards of public safety.” Wachers clarified Singh’s intentions, “The bottled water companies are being stigmatized by government environmental agencies because of the impact on empty plastic bottles in the New City City Landfill. The problem originated with the decline in the quality of drinking water in New City.”  This unorthodox approach to environmental law is applauded by many, but treated by suspicion by other environmentally concerned bodies. 









	STYLISH ATTORNEY ROBIN HOOD OR CONTRADICTION?

	Abbie S.Korpis is without a doubt a living contradiction. Known as somewhat of a ‘Robin Hood’ for women faced with divorce, she is also somewhat of a lorelei, having been accused of being the “other woman” in more than one divorce proceeding. Korpis has been married an unconfirmed number of times and divorced from each husband. Reportedly most of the men filed for divorce on grounds that Korpis was financially reckless. “She spends money on fashionable clothing and accessories as if it were a duty to be beautiful in public,” said an unnamed judge. A fashion magazine of international repute will feature a story that includes Korpis as an example of a “modern, independent woman with the skills and values of a 17th century courtesan.” Whether this is praise or an indictment remains to be judged by the wider public. “There is no doubt that she is at the cutting edge of the fashion industry,” said Eileen Lefkuss, fashion editor for this paper. Yet she lends her skills to anyone seeking redress in environmental-based conflicts. She has defended landlords facing eminent domain challenges, filed suit against the state for “absorbing” river-front property, and forced the relocation of a water-bottling facility because of the use of PCBs in their water bottles. 









	GATES AND KORPIS FEUD IN AND OUT OF COURTROOM 

	Since attorney Liddy Gates agreed to represent the Goliath Corporation in a suit filed by New City’s legal council Abbie Korpis, a cat fight has broken out in the legal arena. Each lawyer has an impressive record of courtroom victories and each woman is known as somewhat idiosyncratic. Both are fierce opponents in the legal arena. Now, however, there seems to be something personal in each woman’s rhetoric and public statements. “I filed the suit based on an investigation by the District Attorney’s office. Goliath has behaved in a devious manner,” said Korpis. Gates responded.  ”I suspect that the city is guilty of selective prosecution. Goliath has always performed in good faith. Abbie is, as is often the case, in error.”  Korpis quipped, “When she can learn how to dress herself, I’ll take Liddy seriously.” Gates is so determined to triumph that she has hired experts in the field of environmental law. Gates has spent $4,000 for special council and advisors brought in from other cities where large corporations have faced suits and prosecutions in the area of toxic waste management. Since Gates has never lost a case where she was lead attorney, it is difficult to question her strategy. This reported tried to find a neutral party who could discuss the case without emotional involvement, but it seems that everyone has chosen a side in this affair.

Huge Oil Spill in New City!

NEW CITY – Disaster struck early this morning this morning as a double-hulled oil tanker ran aground in the New City River, oozing tons of oil into the waterway.   The LX-class inland tanker clipped the shoals of the coast of New City shortly after 2:38 AM.  Miraculously, no one on board was hurt. 
Interstate Oil and Gas, a company that owns several area refineries and owns and operates the wrecked tanker, held a brief press conference in the minutes following the incident.  According to spokesperson Luke Ewter, the vessel -- an inland tanker in service since 2004 -- was piloted by experienced river captain Kent C. Wells and was en route to one of its refineries further up the River.  Ewter also mentioned that all five of the storage tanks in the vessel burst when it scraped along the shoals of the New City River, spilling up to 3500 long tons of oil into the channel.
Witnesses to the event were shocked as they watched the early morning events unfold.  Working late at his waterfront marine craft sales and rental facility, Mack McKinnon said he saw everything.  “It happened all of a sudden.  I could hear the screams of the crew from my shop.  Aye, it gave me a scare, as I imagined they were all plungin’ into the drink!”

Residents are already reporting concern over what the possible effects of the spill may be.  Some are voicing concerns about the long term effects of the spill, and others express trepidation that the ecosystem will ever completely recover.  Already, a putrid smell is wafting ashore – which, according to area conservationist Budo Khan may contain benzene and other volatile compounds.  “We should be concerned about our environment and the river’s ecosystem – but we should also keep in mind that what we smell at the waterfront contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.”  Others aren’t so scientific about it.  “My main concern,” said New City’s official tour guide, Samantha Walker, “is that it will scare away visitors to New City.  Who would want to come here when there is a giant oil spill in our beautiful river?”
