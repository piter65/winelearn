General idea.

 Populate a small world with several experts on aspects of wine.
 Player interviews these experts, and learns.

INITIALLLY:
  It would start in the virtual wine academy.  (team office).
    Several experts would be there to talk to:
        The Dean of the academy (currennt Evelyn)
        The Hospitality Expert.  (someone sharp looking- )
        The Napa/Sonoma Expert - AVA guy.  (probably average looking person).
        (etc).

	Each expert would have a certain amount of content to answer questions,
         and a quiz available at all times.
	If the player chooses the quiz, they pass that aspect of knowlege.

 	The dean would recommend what quizes are available, and where to go to next.
	After all quizes complete, the dean hands out virtual diploma.


    For now, we keep main street, but start cutting out other stuff.  Try to get the size way down.
    Very few "tricks" or gamey puzzles, but more of an interactive way to get, review, and be tested on
  information.   I figure I'll write the initial scripts, and have an SME double check my info.





-----------
 Long Term:
    We have maybe 12 offices, lots of hills with vineyards, outdoor characters, a farmer, etc.  
Until I figure funding out, we use existing assets from Spill.
