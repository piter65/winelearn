Although Korpis wasn’t born in New City, she is a high-profile transplant known to many locals.  Before coming to New City, Abigail Susan Korpis was married twice; once, to her high school sweetheart between 1980-1990, and again, to his best friend, between 1991 and 1998.  Born in Wexlerberg, Abbie is best known for her propensity to wear too much makeup in public – as well her addiction to shopping.  In fact, her consumption is not only conspicuous, but legendary:  she is said to have run through both of her husband’s fortunes buying clothing, jewelry, shoes and accessories.  It has even been reported that she owns over 2000 pairs of shoes – and that when she moved to New City, she brought an entire truck filled with only her wardrobe.  Korpis turned her life around after her divorces, however, by making her propensity for  divorce into a livelihood.  Shortly after finalizing her second divorce, she moved to New City to pursue a dream, starting a local law firm specializing in divorce law.  She now dedicates herself to providing personalized divorce law services to area women of all social backgrounds.",

The Statewide Whaling Association has contracted famed PR firm Narravi Associates to turn around its troubled reputation. “Today, people think of whales as intelligent and peaceful,” explained Narravi’s President, Nina Ojeda.  “After our campaign, people will see them as dangerous and delicious.”  While most PR firms would shrink from the expected environmental media storm, Narravi Associates has proven that they can weather the rough seas of negative press and maintain a positive tone.  That kind of skill doesn’t come cheap. The firm has already spent $1800 on extra desks, phone lines, anti-static floor mats and new hires to take on the project – not to mention $500 to outfit their offices with ergonomic phones to handle the influx of calls.  But some see these expenses as a drop in the ocean if Naravi can deliver the pro-whaling message state wide.  “We’re drowning out here!,” cried one out-of-state fisherman,” Hopefully, everyone will soon realize the health and industrial benefits of whale meat!”

Local EMT John Gray arrived at Navari Associates at 8:40 PM Wednesday to discover several Navari staffers in fits of volcanic nausea. The culprit – leftover sushi.  “We…couldn’t…let…the…tobiko rolls…go to waste!” heaved one queasy copywriter. It was an embarrassing scene for a company that prides itself on its exceptional staff of information experts with clear communication skills. “How smart can they be if they don’t know to keep away from 6 hour old raw fish?” questioned Gray. “What makes me sick,” complained Tilda Tattle, an industry insider, “Is that they billed their client $500 for all that ptomaine take-out!  Ojeda really knows how to make her clients do whatever she wants. She’ll probably figure out a way to charge them for the ambulance bill too!” Nina Ojeda, the president of Navari, publicly laughed off the episode – “We’re paid to spin, so who can blame us if we get a little dizzy sometimes?”

The resulting media firestorm could have destroyed Redolent Inc. if it wasn’t for the swift action by talented PR firm, Navari Associates. “Everyone wanted to blame Redolent,” explains Navari’s president Nina Ojeda, “but they were just as surprised as everyone else.” The Navari “Surprise!” campaign went statewide with a $1200 media buy which explained how the previous landowner, ChemKo, failed to disclose the dump to Gemini.  “Chemko’s the real culprit here,” says lawyer, Anthony Dewey,”I smell a lawsuit.” Navari’s campaign projected a positive image of Redolent throughout the harsh press coverage – a technique honed over years of servicing high end business clients. So even though the mall still stinks, Redolent has come out smelling like a rose.

            @"It’s an energy crisis for PR firm New Media Communications (NMC) as a shocking controversy rages about their client, Idion Energy.  Last month, Idion became a lightning rod for criticism when they suddenly declared bankruptcy. Today, their top executives have been indicted for fraud.  Now the question is, will NMC also face charges? “Absolutely, positively, in no way whatsoever are we implicated in this,” explained the head of NMC, Gabe Vine.  “We just explain our client’s situation – and explanation doesn’t warrant incarceration.” Vine is well known in local media circles. He has worked in PR his entire life - including a stint at advertising dynamo Ubik & Wittus before he started his own firm. NMC has quickly proven its skill at clearly communicating technical information to the general public and getting its clients’ messages out locally and state wide. And his bright team is amping up its response to the current situation.  They have set up a temporary “war room” near the Idion Energy building -  at a cost of $2000-  in the hope that they can short circuit any more media jolts.

But help is on the way for this latter group now that local PR firm New Media Communications (NMC) is launching a campaign on behalf of the River Blindness Awareness Society. “It starts with getting the word out,” explains NMC president Gabe Vine, “That means flyers, sweat and shoe leather.” NMC has already spent $750 on leaflets that are being handed out throughout the city by NMC’s team of street promoters. But are these promoters also blind to their cause? “I think I’m river deaf!” exclaimed a passer-by who was cornered by a promoter for half an hour, “I’m not exactly sure what they’re talking about.” The confusion comes despite NMC spending $750 on books, magazines, videogames, graphic novels and calls to psychic hotlines to educate his staff on the charity’s goals.  But this vast amount of information only seems to confuse the staff.  “It’s lucky River Blindness is already getting good press,” said one street promoter, “because I have no idea what it’s all about.”

They are trying to stop the proposed construction of 18 luxury homes on a strip of private land that cuts into Tamiroff Park. But faster than you can say “eminent domain”, Gary Vine of New Media Communication rushed to the aid of BluCo, taking questions from the crowd. “Won’t these houses, like, ruin the natural look of the park?” asked protester Groovy Gary.  “You won’t even see these houses from the park,” Vine explained, “They’re going to have these huge, high fences all around them.” Vine’s answer seemed to alarm the mob.  “What are these fences?  We never heard about fences!” yelled Polly Yanna at Vine.  “Don’t worry- the fences will be beautiful – they’re being made out of old growth redwood from the park itself!” As the crowd got uglier, Vine deployed his team of street promoters to hand out flyers stating, “If You Love the Park So Much, Buy a BluCo Home!” A fight immediately broke out among the promoters and protesters. Vine says his flyers – which cost his client $750 – were completely destroyed in the melee. NMC is usually known for its ability to communicate technical information to the public, but this PR event definitely left more questions than answers.

            @"“The success is uncanny!” glowed North Countries Tourism Board chairman, Jared Fisk, over a new ad campaign that has spawned an 850% increase in regional tourism. The ads, created by world-wide media relations giant Norse Communications feature clear, startling facts about the health benefits of canned fish. “We believe the tagline, ‘Come and Order the Canned Fish’, is a great hook,” remarked Norse’s chief spokesman, Bjorn Egan. The advertising budget for the campaign reached $1500 and there was an additional expense of $750 for long-distance phone calls to various branches of Norse Communication’s worldwide team. ”They took a global approach to our local goals,” says Fisk, “and ended up putting us on the map.” Norse’s big fish status has some smaller ad agencies griping that the company concentrates on “softball” clients while it doesn’t do so well communicating really controversial issues. Egan shrugs off such criticism saying, “If it wasn’t for us, even cartographers wouldn’t know where the North Countries are.”

            @"Maybe it’s the godlike bleach blonde hair, or penchant for sparse, tasteful wooden furniture, but something seems different about the staff at the New City offices of Norse Communications. It should - not one of them is from around here. “Naturally, there is plenty of local PR talent in New City,” says Bjorn Egan, “But our company’s global stature means we can bring in the best minds from around the world.” Or at least from around North Country. It is true, however, that the New City affiliate can tap into the huge resources of one of the strongest media relations businesses in the world. Some wonder if this is always a good thing. “We weren’t disappointed – we were shocked,” says one former client in New City, “Norse charged us $500 for weird, inappropriate things like hair dye, techno CDs, herbal teas and sun lamps – I mean, how can they justify that?” When asked, Egan doesn’t flinch, “PR is the work of the mind – for the mind to be efficient, it must be happy, there are studies which prove this.” Translation? Blondes have more fun.

            @"There’s something fishy going on in Elliot County. While the rest of the world gobbles up canned fish like voracious polar bears with can openers, the people of New City have yet to catch on. The dramatic increase in canned salmon sales has been attributed to the successful ad campaign by Norse Communications for the North Countries Tourism Board. The ads feature stark images, dramatizing the health benefits of eating fish with the clever tagline, “Order the Canned Fish”. Norse drew on its experts from around the world to clearly communicate the messages. But despite a national and statewide advertising budget of $1500 and the fact that the ads were created at Norse’s affiliate here in New City, no one in Elliot County is biting. “Maybe they are too stupid for these ads,” mused Norse president Bjorn Egan, “In which case, they should eat more fish.” Egan’s “stupid” comment has angered some local residents and shown that Norse doesn’t always tackle sensitive situations well. “If they want to reel us in,” says local curmudgeon Granny Smith, “they shouldn’t oughta insult our intelligences!”

Known for inspired, creative work, MRI is still a relatively small firm staffed with door-to-door salesmen who canvas on behalf of his clients for a fee of $1000. “People aren’t convinced by facts and all that analysis junk – they need a good story and our guys can spin some stories believe you me!” Still, Moneymaker does admit that to grow statewide he will need to hire experts eventually. “Sure, bigger clients have bigger headaches, so we’ll get some eggheads in the office when the time comes – but for right now, our guys do all right.” Currently, MRI only services clients in Elliot County and, while plans for expansion are sketchy, Moneymaker’s drive and creativity makes his dreams of statewide dominance seem more than likely.

(MRI) does just that by focusing exclusively on local clients. “Everybody’s got money – so why not take it from the guy next door? You just need drive.” And according to Moneymaker, drive comes from motivational CDs and inspirational posters. He charges clients $1000 for these “tools” to keep his team, and himself, in top form. “You gotta feel good – and look good – in the PR game or else nobody’s gonna believe you no matter how much crap you spew.” Moneymaker does look impeccable in his spokesman role, and he should, given the $1500 he spends on a full time stylist to prep him for interviews on his clients’ behalf. But his blunt, no-nonsense manner can ruffle some feathers when a situation calls for subtlety and tact. “Whatever,” Moneymaker shrugs when asked about his lack of sensitivity, “I didn’t get rich by playing footsie – I did it by stomping on toes!”

As Atlast himself explains, “When you get to the top, you’re at the top!” The 92-year-old motivational speaker still makes CDs and posters and Moneymaker is one of his biggest clients. “Every time we get a new job, I buy $500 worth of Bloodline’s stuff,” Moneymaker says, “The staff loves looking at posters of staircases from around the world.” While his small staff does seem motivated, they are not always technically adept to handle the analysis their jobs require. “We’re working on it,” claims Moneymaker, “And I’m working on my own sensitivity.

As always, the charity event required participants to wear blindfolds in solidarity with those afflicted with river blindness, but to make it more interesting, the 24 mile course was lined with shards of broken glass. “The walkers are hard core – they knew what they were getting into,” said Gil Fermin, director of New City Emergency Medics Association, “But we had to create a security perimeter to keep bystanders away from the glass. The deluge of rain made for an extra challenge.” The effective barrier and on-site foot surgery equipment – which cost the event $1800 – kept the event from becoming a bloody, muddy mess. NCEM’s crew of emergency medical and security professionals were prepared at a moments notice. They kept their spirits up with vending machines and ping pong tables at their operations center which was powered by a generator at a rental cost of $500. “It was a test,” admitted Fermin, “But we were inspired by those crazy walkers!”

But it’s what fuels these maxed out EMTs that has some area experts worried. Fermin spends $500 on sugared candies, caffeinated soft drinks and over-the-counter energy pills to make up for their almost total lack of sleep. “Of course, this is ridiculous – all that sugar will ruin their teeth,” complained Dr. Bill Cuspid, a local dentist.

It could have been a complete disaster if not for the swift, effective crowd control response of New City Emergency Medics. “We’ve handled plenty of riots,” says NCEM director Gil Fermin, “But this was the first that involved bedpans.” The personnel expenses for the quick response were $1200 - a small fraction of what the medical costs could have been. The only complaint against NCEM was how disorganized Fermin seemed after the crisis was averted. “He got all the paperwork wrong – he even insisted that it was really the month of May instead of July!” said administrator Sally Firth, “Perhaps he has early onset Alzheimer’s?”

According to papers filed in Wexlerberg County Court today, emergency medical service provider, First Responders, is responsible for the death of Groovy Gary’s pet Rhesus Monkey, Hamm, due to criminal negligence. Gary, an organ grinder, had been searching for his missing monkey for days but wasn’t prepared for the jolt he received when he opened the dumpster outside of the First Responders’ building. “He was like a little fried chicken with hair,” cried Gary, “All because of the shockie thing in the trash!” The “shockie thing” was a defective defibrillator First Responders had thrown out the day before. Lawyers from the firm of Bendham & Breakham, who represent First Responders, claim the suit is frivolous. “My client is known for its rapid response to disasters and having only the best, newest equipment,” explains partner Ken Breakham, “That’s precisely why the defibrillator in question was in the dumpster – it was old.” First Responders, a very successful business that provides emergency services to corporate clients is known to charge up to $2000 to deploy its personnel to disaster sites, commonly upgrades its equipment. “Besides,” continues Breakham, “the monkey clearly wasn’t trained and licensed to operate the defibrillator, so he assumes the risk.” A ruling on the case is expected soon.

They’re also known for having fun. “We don’t just protect the party,” says owner John Gray, “we bring it!” In addition to medical supplies, Gray’s team also brought raw meat, cole slaw, hush puppies and sweetened ice tea for a real dixie-style barbeque at a cost of $750. “I was totally enjoying myself and the banana pudding,” says Tyme, “until the clowns came.” At first, the crowd cheered as several tiny cars raced past the sawhorse barrier. Moments later – chaos. “I looked up from the barbeque pit and two cars had skidded into a group of teenagers,” remembers Gray, “There were teens and clowns everywhere!” The First Responder team sprang into action – treating cuts, bruises and one broken funny bone. “First Responders did a great job patching things up,” said Skip Tick, a party participant, “But where was their crowd control? Those clowns should’ve never been able to crash the gate like that.”

Unfortunately for Mr. Peterson, it was several hours before medics treated him. “We hired First Responders – they came highly recommended by other companies to handle medical emergencies at corporate events,” says Peterson, “But they were nowhere to be found – I had to bite on my wallet for the pain.” First Responders is known to be well equipped and trained to handle a wide variety of emergency situations, but they were too busy preparing value-added festivities. “Our clients want more than emergency services,” says owner John Gray, “They want protection and a party.” Gray himself was setting up a barbeque during the shooting while his staff was off getting massages and facial treatments by the spa workers Gray hired for $500 to work the event. “Maybe they ought to stick with the protection,” complained Peterson, “Though the barbeque was delicious.”

Inc. seems obvious: Barrier is a decorated military hero with years of specialized emergency response training; Its $1250 expense to mobilize security and medical responders to a disaster site is the lowest of any bid; There were, in fact, no other bidders for the contract. Rosenfield Councilman Eli Techme explained the decision this way, “Medic! Inc. is the best, cheapest and only solution for Rosenfield’s Tsunami threats.” However, there are some who question Medic! Inc.’s response time track record. “We think of the military as very efficient,” says industry analyst Mark Etforces, “But there are so many layers of command that it really gets bogged down – that might spell disaster when a Tsunami strikes.” Fortunately, Rosenfield is thousands of miles inland and surrounded by a mountain range which makes the feared Tsunami practically unthinkable here.

Inc.’s military style convoy and camouflage uniforms caught the attention of local press. “We saw something weird fall from the sky and then all these military guys showed up,” said local farm reporter Clem Cowpie, “We thought for sure we was bein’ alien invaded!” This touched off a media free- for-all that inundated Fence’s farm while the medics were trying to save the animals. Even with $1500 of new medic field kits, Medic! Inc. couldn’t save the llamas as press trampled over Fence’s fence to find out about the aliens. “Stand down! Stand down!” Medic!

After years of celebrated service as chief surgeon at New City Community Hospital, Dr. Mullen hung up his scalpel. But after a few months he found that leisure time was overrated. “I went from making life and death decisions every day to making cookies,” explains Dr. Mullen, “and they were awful.”  So Dr. Mullen got together with other dissatisfied health care retirees and started Mullen Medical Supply, Inc.  At first, these silver-haired second-timers focused on selling “gently used” medical equipment. “We got aneurism needles, and hernia knives – high, hot and helluva lot!” exclaims Mullen. But even that got, well, old. So they started providing emergency medical services for events. Charging only $1000 to respond to medical emergencies, Mullen Medical began working weddings, bar mitzvahs and block parties – after their afternoon naps, of course.

Some parents questioned why safety personnel needed scooters at all. “How can you corral kids if you can’t even walk?” complained one parent.

Two months ago, Dr. Mullen performed his last aria on the operating table and went into retirement. The medical world was shocked. “I thought they’d need to pry that scalpel from his cold, dead hands,” says long time friend and fellow doctor, Jim Bonesaw, “He never wanted to retire.” But a life of 16 hour workdays and being on-call seven days a week finally took its toll. “I’m tired and I want to see the world,” remarked Mullen in his retirement speech. But after a brief trip to Ohio, Dr. Mullen is back and has started his own emergency medical response service, Mullen Medical Supply, Inc. His equipment and disaster training are not up-to-date, but they are cutting-edge. “I have this wonderful Civil War surgery kit that comes in handy for field amputations,” says Dr. Mullen. He also packs tarps, card tables, a tent and mosquito nets – total cost around $1000 – into his car to set up a triage area at a moment’s notice. His response team is also on the worn side, made up of other retired health and security professionals. “Sure we’re old,” snaps Dr. Mullen, “But we can handle a crowd – as long as they’re sedated with morphine.” Despite his team’s lack of speed or strength, it is wonderful to see the maestro of mastectomies back in action.

            @"When raw sewage leaked from a garbage tanker on the New City River, it created a puzzling, smelly engineering challenge. Mack McKinnon, a New City River expert, explains,” The sewage spread out towards the banks, but it was also pulled downstream by the current, which is wicked fast at that point.” So, how do you contain a spill moving in several directions from despoiling the entire river? Peter Boltright of Premiere Containment had the answer. “A vortex. Instead of scooping the spreading goop from above - which takes a long time and spreads it even more - we create a tornado, essentially, from below that sucks the sewage into a drum on the river bottom. It’s never been done before!” Reaction to the idea was mixed. “People thought Pete was crazy,” remembers McKinnon, “But it turned out – like always – that he was right.” Boltright deployed his team of crane operators and machinists – at a cost of $1200 – to get his invention called the “Containment Cyclone” into the river quickly. When he hit the switch, a powerful whirlpool immediately formed. “It was awesome to see,” remember McKinnon, “Pete had set the vibration density – or something – so that only the specific gravity of the sewage got pulled the bottom.” The entire stinky spill was contained within a few hours. “We were out boating that afternoon,” McKinnon remembers happily.

Mercury – so what!” exclaimed Matt Hadder, owner of Lightsee Products, a fluorescent light manufacturer, “We used it in baby thermometers for years and nobody worried!” But as the mercury levels rise in the Himahoochie River outside Hadder’s factory, Wexlerberg residents’ concerns have reached a fever pitch. Enter Peter Boltright, the bearded New City toxic spill containment expert and owner of Premier Containment. “We all know that mercury gets into fish,” Boltright said as he outlined his solution, “So I plan to build a school of mechanical fish to filter the mercury from the water.” The idea seemed ridiculous, complicated and infeasible – it was immediately adopted in a 6 to 1 city council vote. Boltright’s set up shop onsite and charged $500 for drafting supplies, protyping materials and the rental of a 3D printer. “What’s all this?” complained Hadder, “First the city tells me to clean the water – now it makes me pay for some guy in overalls to tinker in a shed – I’m moving my factory to Indonesia!”  While the rest of the containment industry scoffed, Boltright’s team of crane operators and machinists transported the shoal of “containment cod” into the river. Weeks later, the Himahoochie is mercury free. “Holy Mackerel!” exclaimed Hadder as he left for Jakarta, “It worked!”

            @"Summer’s here which means one thing in New City – toxic algae blooms in the river. These psychedelic green organisms known as cyanobacteria secrete flesh eating toxins and pose a hazard to swimmers and boaters. But they’re not scary to the Machinists and Crane operators of Premier Containment who do a charity swim every year to bring attention to the algae issue. “Oh yeah, it burns your eyes, ears and skin,” says Mack McMack one of a dozen crane operators that Premier deploys to containment sites at a cost of $1200, “And if you swallow a teaspoonful you’ll have diarrhea for weeks – but it’s all for a good cause.” While Boltright and his team are the leading authorities in containing river spills, the cyanobacteria has them stumped. “I’ve been obsessively tinkering for years with different inventions to counteract the blooms,” explains Boltright, “But until the public changes its habits, nothing I do is gonna stop the flesh eating junk.” So, once a year, Boltright and his men jump into the green goopy nightmare hoping the spectacle will make a difference. “Unfortunately the only change I’ve noticed,” says McMack, “Is that I’m one ear shy of a pair.”

            @"Teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime. Teach a fisherman to contain a toxic spill and you have given him a new purpose and a supplemental income. That’s the lesson being taught by Running Rivers Corporation’s founder Oroko Nakashima. By applying traditional fishing techniques of her Pacific Rim homeland, Nakashima is able to provide aging fishermen a way to heal the environment. “These people know the sea,” explains Nakashima, “Now they can use their vast skills to save it.” She has successfully deployed local fishermen along with conservationists to contain a variety of toxic spills at a cost of $1250. Using experienced fishermen also helps her transport containment equipment quickly to exactly where it’s needed. “Ms. Nakashima is awesome,” says New City fisherman Ernie Herringbone, “She taught us old salts all the latest containment techniques – she’s also got all the right equipment for any kind of spill.” But Nakashima says it’s the fishermen that have taught her,” Without their understanding of the ways of the water, I would never be able to tackle these huge challenges.” This mutually beneficial relationship has made Nakashima one of the most sought after containment specialists in the world.

            @"Some coasts get inundated with jellyfish, but the small South Seas island of Wymee got hit with a different problem – gelatin. “Our tanker got caught in some rough seas,” explains Captain Herc Frate, “And our entire shipment of gelatin went into the drink.” By morning, Wymee islanders were surprised to find their pristine blue waters all wobbly. “You know that dream where you’re trying to get away but you can’t move,” explains one native, “That was my morning swim.” To clean up the jellified coast, Wymee called on noted containment specialist Oroko Nakashima and her New City company Running Rivers Corporation. “We used local fisherman and conservationists to get to the site quickly,” explains Nakashima, “But sailing through the jelly was very difficult.” With her team’s up to date training and conservation techniques, Nakashima was able to contain the gelatin and create a side business for the islanders. “They are now selling some seaweed jelly that is actually very delicious,” she explains. Only one thing still puzzles the Wymee people. Nakashima always hires a troupe of acupuncturists and herbalists to accompany expeditions – something the islanders had never seen. “We are grateful for Ms. Nakashima’s help,” says an island leader, “But why did we pay $500 for people to prick us with pins?”

            @"“Of course I know what a river is,” says toxic spill containment expert Oroko Nakashima, “The name of my company is Running Rivers Corporation, after all.” But the very fact that she doesn’t know rivers are actually blue – or sometimes brown – highlights the fact that she’s never actually worked on one. “Ms. Nakashima is respected all over the world for her ocean spill experience,” explains Leon Stienbot, president of New City Community College where Nakashima works part-time as a professor, “It will be hilariously easy for her to learn how to clean a little thing like a river.” But others disagree. “No sir! Rivers ain’t nothing like oceans,” explains dockworker Hal Hearty, “Rivers are long and skinny and oceans are salty!” That could mean that Nakashima’s ocean equipment – heavy duty oil containment booms, liners and berms to prevent cross-contamination and sinkage at a cost of $1500 – might be too big or too salty to work in our rivers. But Nakashima explains that she always consults with local fisherman and conservationists on any job and to mobilize the appropriate equipment. As for her supposed “river blindness”, Nakashima says, “I certainly don’t claim to know everything, but I did grow up on this planet and have seen plenty of rivers. I look forward to New City’s next toxic disaster to prove myself.”

            @"It was all thumbs-ups and a-okays when hazardous waste containment experts the Burells brothers returned from a deployment in the republic of Zamunda. With all the fanfare of a victory parade, the former Marines landed aboard an aircraft carrier in the New City River. It’s widely believed that it was brother Phil who emerged first from the plane, followed by nearly identical-looking Bill. With their shaved heads, sunglasses and stiff military composure, it’s hard to be certain who it was that stepped up to the podium mike and said, “Mission accomplished.” When asked by one playful reporter if they had delivered a Marine-style “whooping” to the troubling waste that plagued the Sub-equatorial nation, it was either Bill or Phil who responded by stating, “That would be impossible, since waste doesn’t have anything to whoop.”  By most accounts, however, the brothers did attack the problem like a military campaign, leveraging their extensive network of ex-military service people and state militia members to help with the containment effort, at a cost of $1250. Known great successes while serving in the military and responding to disasters around the world, the brothers have an aggressive approach—too aggressive for some human rights and environmental watch dogs, who level charges of collateral damage, claiming that entire villages where inadvertently destroyed by their take-no-prisoners, “scorched earth” tactics.

            @"Local waste warriors the Burells brothers are taking incoming fire on their recent expenses racked up while on a cleanup excursion in Zamunda. The former Marines deployed a “major containment effort” in the faraway region and, by most accounts, were successful in cleaning up hazardous materials. However, questions have emerged about the firm’s extreme methods and what appear to inappropriate expenses. While the Burells claim to cut expenses by leveraging an extensive network of ex-military service people and contacts in the state militia to work the cleanup transport hardware to sites, however remote, their efforts to keep these service people entertained during off hours has raised some eyebrows. Specifically, the charge of $500 for video games, DVDs, and informative industrial shorts to be by played in the ‘rec tent’ between shifts is considered unnecessary by many. When questioned, the Burells have defended their actions, stating, “You don’t want these people running around a village somewhere. Keeping ‘em busy at the base is the way to go.” To clarify, Phil added, “Last time we didn’t bring enough DVDs, we ended up having to find homes for a lot of kids. Long story.” It’s one of many stories that human rights watchdog groups have pressed to hear, as it seems it’s not just the Burells’ expenses that some find objectionable.

            @"Burells Brothers use of decommissioned military spill containment equipment may soon come to an end as the company is hit with charges that the equipment is faulty. If environmental watchdog Ronnie Mess has his way, the Burells will cease all deployments of said equipment immediately. “You don’t use old, outdated equipment to clean toxic waste,” Mess explained. The pressure from advocates like Mess could threaten the Burells’ business model, which relies heavily upon leveraging an extensive network of ex-military service people and contacts for personnel and cheap transport. They claim that they spend $1500 on maintenance and service for the decommissioned military spill containment equipment they use in the field. In defense of his company’s practices, Bill Burell has said the equipment is solid. “Anyone who questions old military equipment is welcome to stand in front of my vintage M-1 carbine rifle, which was carried by my father in Korea, and let me take a shot.” “This stuff was built to last,” adds Phil, “just like the Corps. Semper Fi, people!” Advocates disagree. “If the equipment was sound,” Mess asks, “why do we have reports of hairless llamas in Mesoamerica?” At press time, the Burells couldn’t be reach for comment since they insist on using WW II era radios in the field.

            @"It’s not often that you hear the words “Anthony Wexler really delivered,” unless you’re talking about the self-proclaimed hazmat expert delivering yet another blow to our environment. This time, however, the news is positive—as is often the case when Wexler relies on luck over skill. Yes, with a fluke throw at this weekends National Dart-o-rama, Wexler claimed the top prize and promptly donated his winnings to charity—a nice gesture from a man whose botched waste containment efforts have led to some embarrassing circumstances, not to mention freakish mutations. Some definitely see the money as payback from a man whose organization makes $1000 payments to local bar owners for the disclosure of names of dart league members that Wexler mobilizes for containment efforts. This practice is widely criticized by critics who claim Wexler is not able to drum up the kind of support necessary to respond to disasters on time. The same critics are also quick to point out Wexler’s extremely odd, out-of-date equipment, and widely held impression that he is uninformed in containment and prevention techniques. Yet, Wexler’s extraordinary luck has bailed him out of disasters countless times. “I’ve seen the man set fire to a river,” says environmental watchdog Norm Alguy, “only to have a rainstorm come out of nowhere and put it out. He’s a walking disaster that somehow comes out okay, usually at the expense of the environment.”

            @"The Elliot County Dart Association may have put the brakes on an afternoon of good times, but they also may have spared your offspring the discomforts of a lifetime with flippers for hands.. It all depends on how you look at the Association’s refusal to give tournament status to a dart game planned for next month, due to the proposed location’s proximity to a radioactive toxic waste leak. Anthony Wexler, organizer of the event and founder of Interstate Containment, expressed disappointment over the decision. His company was contracted to address the leak. “The whole idea was to work on the leak and little, play some darts, work on the leak some more,” he explains. “I mean, who says radioactive waster cleanup has to be a drag?” Wexler’s plans were signaled by the $500 request for dartboards, extra felt, darts, tips, and a bouncer detail to ensure order during off-shift dart games. He also intended to enlist players into the cleanup effort—a tactic he has used before, though critics note that the strategy prevents Wexler from drumming up the support needed to successfully address to respond to disasters in time. “Sure, maybe there were some additional costs to pulling this off,” Wexler admits. “But one thing the Association is unwilling to recognize is that we wouldn’t have need spend money for lighting, since the leak has a bright glow to it.”

            @"A guitar amp. A toaster. A computer monitor or luggage. These are common items purchased through online auctions. So what about hazardous waste containment equipment? “Sure. Why not?” says Anthony Wexler, founder of Interstate Containment. “It’s so much cheaper than going directly to reputable dealers, and sometimes you find cool stuff when you’re washing it off that first time. Like I found a watch once, but no one can wear it for 700 years because of the radioactivity.” Wexler recently acquired containment and transportation equipment at an online auction for $1000. When questioned about quality secondhand equipment, purchased sight-unseen from faraway strangers, Wexler has no qualms, saying, “Did I mention the watch?” This low budget approach to hazardous waste containment and prevention makes some nervous. Indeed Wexler’s critics are numerous, and many believe that past successes have come from Wexler’s famous luck, not outstanding containment. His lack of resources and reliance on fellow dart players to assist with cleanup efforts have led many to conclude that he can’t drum up the support necessary to respond in time to disasters. Second rate equipment of the type found in online auctions only adds to his shoddy reputation. “The thing about equipment,” Wexler explains, “is a lot of it is just for show. But most of the time a whole mess of paper towels can do the trick.” It’s comments like this that lead many to believe Wexler bought his hazmat credentials at an online auction as well.

            @"The cavalry rode into town today, just in the nick of time to save environmental specialist Nathaniel Wailer from being overwhelmed by his workload. In tackling the task of toxic waste cleanup off the Bay Coast, the respected, but overworked, Wailer was forced to send out an SOS to his team of experts from his island home of Montoga at a cost of $1200. “Sometimes you need a brother to back you up,” Wailer explained. The dreadlocked homeboys, who arrived by helicopter, brought with them an abundance of upbeat island spirit. “Don’t worry, be happy,” one team member told a reporter as he stepped out of the tellingly hazy interior of the chopper. “After all, it’s only toxic waste, mon.” While the sentiment is likely the result of natural optimism, residents of Bay Coast should be comforted by Wailer’s presence. He has a track record of accuracy and is known to be free of biases.. And he’s an expert with cutting-edge technology that allows him to measure sinkage, spread, and cross-contamination at the spill site. His record of successes has made him a man in demand, yet he remains humble and committed to helping all that he can, which seems more likely now that his team has arrived. “Every-ting’s going to be all right,” said a team member, who added, “Oh hey, mon, where can I get some potato chips, or maybe some nachos?”

            @"Executives of the now-defunct Idion Energy found the findings of environmental consultant Nathaniel Wailer “deeply offensive and pretty mean, too.” The irate, and now largely unemployable, executives met with the media today to list their grievances and dispute the facts of Wailer’s scathing report, which many believe led to the environmentally-unfriendly corporation’s demise. “It’s one thing to be critical of our policies,” former Vice President Rex Holmes, “but he also took the time to attack our weight challenges and our supposed lack of style. I mean, do you think I want this comb-over?” Reached for comment, the dreadlocked Wailer insists nothing in his report was personal. “These people are just trying to generate some sympathy,” he stated. “I never hold a comb-over against a mon. That would be kicking him when he’s down.” Many credible sources have publicly agreed with Wailer’s environmental assessment, which exposed Idion as a major polluter. And while they recognize Wailer’s track record of accuracy and know him to be free of biases from having never worked in corporations or local government, not all of Wailer’s tactics get the thumbs up from experts. Many have asked, “What’s up with the fruit?” The question concerns the $500 expense of organic fruits, vegetables, sugar-free candies and other refreshments for assessment personnel. “This is a team that often gets the munchies, mon,” Wailer explains. “Better to have healthy food on-hand when it hits.”

When asked about his skills, the highly successful Wailer offers this explanation: “In my youth and in college, I was constantly challenged to come up with ways to improvise swimming pool pumps…” before trailing off with a shrug and a knowing smile. Whatever his training, Wailer’s methods of maintaining equipment are widely known to be unusual and eccentric, but also highly effective. And when the going gets tough at spill sites, Wailer has another ace up his sleeve: A team of dreadlocked Montogan environmentalists that he can fly in at a moment’s notice for a fee of $1200. The team, respected for their mellow, after-work parties nearly as much as their ecological engineering skills, work in the syncopated and harmonious manner of a reggae band. Wailer, who can be said to serve as the outfits lead singer and lyricist, is an inspiring and well-spoken leader, who always delivers his findings in a clear and concise manner. So, as unusual, imaginative, unconventional Wailer may be, his clients are complaining. On the contrary, officials like Sandy Krotsch are singing his praises, stating, “Wailer makes everything feel all right and he never bogarts his skills and, uh, talents.”

Ypoforo has been tapped to monitor the activity of the volcanic Mt. Guga, whose recent rumblings are threatening this island paradise. Economou, aging playboy and known Classicist, ended the conference by stating, “While ‘tis sorrow that binds the human race, we shall refrain from inviting the gods to fuse our souls with the angry fires of the underworld.” Many in attendance found the statement confusing, if not exceedingly pretentious. This has happened before. At times disorganized and unruly in appearance, the famous consultant has difficulty concisely communicating his findings, not to mention his intentions. Yet, his record speaks for itself. His many successes are no doubt the result of his considerable expertise, as well as up-to-date training and equipment needed to monitor. The equipment, which costs $750, includes monitoring cells, buoys, air and water sample kits, and other measurement equipment for ecosystem. Clients have also seen positive results from the globally dispersed team of specialists Economou will occasionally fly in to assist with the operation, though taxes and fees associated with redeeming frequent flyer miles amount to $750. “He’s kind of a poetry spewing swinger with more hair on his chest than his head,” said San Laissez restaurant-owner Les Esmoore. “But I’ll take his hot air over that volcano’s any day of the week.”

His intended destination was Eye Station Optometry, Pete’s neighbor, and the incident was yet more evidence that Economou’s failing eyesight could lead to problems in the future. There have been other indicators: For his recent cleanup job at Statewide Widgets, the bill included $500 for eyeglasses, magnification lenses, special large-print reports and other visual aids to help the analyst see small LED readouts on monitoring equipment. The charge was initially disputed by Stateside, but was paid in full after executives were invited to dine with Economou on his yacht with his close friend Sting, who reportedly demonstrated some of his favorite yoga positions. When queried about his vision, Economou’s organization, Ypoforo Ecosystems, released a statement that reads: “Mr. Economou continues to enjoy 20/20 vision.” Further reading of the release’s fine print reveals that his 20/20 vision is limited to “areas” of his left eye and only in well-lit conditions, such as midday or on movie or TV sets or operating rooms where high quality and intense lighting is provided by “artificial sources of professional quality.” Otherwise, the release concludes, the aging playboy environmentalist is very nearly blind. The dispatch ended by stating, “Mr. Economou would like to remind all that the epic poet Homer, author of The Iliad, was blind and yet he saw more deeply into the hearts of man than anyone to walk the earth.”

In a bold move for the large, multinational operation, Multrix has opted to outright reject the findings of Windfall Partners, which the they claim has “loaded their assessment with conclusions that are suspiciously pro-government and inappropriately critical of our love for accessories, especially necklaces.” After an international search for a new vendor, they decided on Jannis Economou and his company, Ypoforo, for a number of reasons. Said Guy Dangette, Vice President of Operations for Multrix, “We recognize a number of synergies with Mr. Economou’s organization. Additionally, Ypoforo has a reputation for being a provider of fully independent, peer-reviewed, accurate and unbiased reports. Plus, the man knows his gold chains.” Neckwear aside, Economou does have some drawbacks that Multrix is apparently willing to overlook. For example, there’s the $750 fee for monitoring cells, bouys, air and water sample kits, and other measurement equipment. Plus, Economou is occasionally disorganized and unruly in appearance. A lover of Classic poetry, he has been known to deliver his findings in dense, archaic and pretentious verse. “Fine with us,” claims Dangette, adding, “have you seen him?.”

The incident, which occurred when Rose and her team of volunteers powered their gear by running non-insulated cables from the Pond’s boathouse wall sockets, horrified picnickers, fisherman and hordes of schoolchildren on an environmental field trip. “Animals shouldn’t twitch like that,” an angry teacher commented. “Especially not in front of the children.” The clean-up effort saw park employees working overtime to clear the Pond’s surface of lifeless creatures with hand nets. “Ramblin’ Rose should stick to flower power,” said one waterlogged ranger, referencing Rose’s hippy origins. “No one ever zapped frogs with peace, love and understanding.”  Reached for comment on her chartered psychedelic bus, which she uses to ship an army of volunteers at a cost of $1250, a besieged Ramblin’ Rose blamed the mishap on faulty equipment recently purchased from online auction houses. “Hey, man, you never know what you’re getting from some of those Internet cats,” she explained. “It’s hard to assess someone’s aura over the computer, you dig?”

            @"When legendary 90’s jam band The Boys let their freak flags fly, Ramblin’ Rose stood and saluted. She also left behind all her belongings and followed the band on a long strange trip that, years later, has landed her in a role that is part environmental consultant, part hippie guru. Sometimes people find it hard to tell the two roles apart, like when Rose—at a cost of $750—uses incense, flowers and bootleg Boys cassettes to serve as sensory aids during the presentation of assessment report findings. Her eccentric style of communicating her findings can be hard to follow. For example, a positive report is often described as “totally cosmic” while a negative assessment has been known to “harsh her mellow”. Field tactics, such as using $1500 animal-friendly monitoring stakes to track ground water remediation efforts, also reveal a live-and-let-live outlook. Though her practice of buying equipment from online auction houses has led to some negative outcomes, she has built a reputation as an unbiased and accurate assessor.  “The Boys taught me to love everything equally,” she explains, then somberly adds, “especially, Jimmy. I see his crazy soul in all living things, even jellyfish, and those things are pretty gross, man.” The passing of guitarist Jimmy Rodriguez, who died tragically when The Boys were at their peak, still haunts Ramblin’ Rose, who claims to bear a tattoo proclaiming “Jimmy Forever” somewhere on her her left forearm.

The move has saved countless animal lives. “I’ll do anything to see that no animals come to harm,” she proclaims. Her integrity is indeed legendary; she is known for refusing to give into the demands of “the man” and prides herself on producing fully independent and accurate findings, while ensuring that flora and fauna aren’t spoiled by her examinations. And while her credibility as an environmental assessor is sometimes undermined by her eccentric presentation style, which often feels like a symposium for 90’s jam band The Boys, her record as a protector of animals is spotless. “Animals have taught me a lot,” she states. “How to live in the moment and how to defend your territory no matter how big your foe,”

Seemingly summoned by the flames of fire-bombing eco-terrorists, McBragg and his Enviro-X team of skater consultants were on the scene last Friday soon after the warehouse at Luxury Heating Oil & Gas Imports was mysteriously set alight. “They responded to assess our storage facility and the surrounding area when it was fire-bombed,” recalls Rob Berry, owner of Luxury Heating Oil & Gas Imports. “It’s funny, I think they were at the site before the cops even got there.  I wonder how they got word of the attack so fast.”  Upon arriving, Enviro-X immediately set about constructing a $1000 assessment command area—consisting of a card table and half-pipe—on the shores of the New City River. Why the need for an on-site ramp? “Because if you don’t shred, you’re dead,” McBragg explained. “Now watch this sweet airwalk grab.” The company’s choice of consultant has left some confused, since it’s widely believed that Enviro-X only provides one-sided assessments that inevitably come down hard on Elliot County. Additionally, there’s speculation that McBragg himself has been known to engage in eco-terrorism and simply doesn’t have the expertise to assess ecological damage, though his vigor and enthusiasm are often cited as positives. When asked if he’s the right man for the job, McBragg responded by performing a wicked Ollie.

Someone took this juvenile idea to a grand scale last Sunday night, when the Morley Sewage Treatment Facility was firebombed and the resulting mess was anything but hilarious. Interestingly, Skeeter McBragg and his Enviro-X assessment firm have been tapped to clean it up, despite a dubious reputation and some unusual costs. For example, Enviro-X charges $1000 for supplies that include measuring tape, rulers, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers and backyard swimming pool water testing kits. While these are sensible expenses, one has to question the $1500 fee for several pounds of explosives, fuses, blasting caps and ignitors, as well as a case of spray paint and a year’s supply of eggs—curious items for a group suspected of creating ecological havoc and believed to be lacking in the expertise needed to assess ecological damage. But with the deal inked, concerned observers can only wait for McBragg’s assessment report, which promises to be interesting given that he is widely believed to be barely literate and questionably sane.

Once they go to work, you can expect refreshingly one-sided assessments aimed at condemning the practice of Elliot County’s biggest corporations. Indeed, McBragg pulls no punches. His reports—rants filled with earthy, honest langauge—amount to what he calls a “swift kick” to environmentally irresponsible companies, and he doesn’t let a lack of evidence get in his way. “They’re are dirty,” he insists. An accomplished skater, McBragg brings scrappy sidewalk surfing ethics into the mix. “These polluters can talk all they want,” he’s been known to say, “but I’m on the only board that matters. Get it? SkateBOARD. Pretty darn funny, huh? Man, sometimes I crack myself up.”

            @"It’s a good idea to have an audience to catch you when executing a classic stage dive. Unfortunately for punk activist and environmental spokesman Wes Berlin, the audience at a recent charity performance fled the area in front of the stage due to the ear-splitting volume of Berlin’s band, Shrapnel. The sound roared through a $4150 PA system, assaulting the retreating audience. This left Berlin without a safety net, causing him to crash to the floor, mic in hand. But the split lip and bloody nose were all part of the experience for the punk veteran, who shook it off and resumed the vocals without missing a beat. The stunt so impressed the audience that they returned to the foot of the stage, weathering the withering blast of the band’s set, making for a successful event, despite numerous complaints about the noise levels. Such is the topsy-turvy world of Wes Berlin, a rising star in the world of charity representation, though he is still more known as a local musician.  He brings a raw punk energy to the scene that serves as a shock to the system. These days Berlin is known to act as a spokesperson for many local charities and champions several community causes. What’s the secret to his success? “I’m absolutely mental,” he claims, affecting a Cockney accent for the sake of punk authenticity. “I’m bloody bonkers.” And what about the noise complaints? “It’s hard to hear the punters complaining when the music’s so loud.”",
//"wes2",
            @"Punk philosophy is driving Wes Berlin, punk legend and emerging environmental spokesperson and advocate. The hard-edged, do-it-yourself punk aesthetic has its place in advocacy, according to Berlin, who thinks it should be applied to every aspect of life. “It’s a bleeding state of mind,” he explains with his adopted English accent. “They should teach it in schools. There should be punk dojos. Yoga’s for tossers. Punk can save the world.” If Berlin’s new career as an environmental spokesperson is any indication of its effectiveness, then he could be right. His string of successes, raising awareness about environmental issues and making it cool to “give a damn,” has put him in high demand. Some still question his unorthodox expenses, such as the $1000 he spent for the giant back tattoo commemorating all the dead baby seals affected by the New City River oil spill disaster—an odd choice of image given no seals were within hundreds of miles of the spill. But who’s going to tell Berlin that, or call him on his $2500 Concert t-shirts and promotional CD’s to give away to adoring fans at his public appearances? Probably no one who can’t see the constructive value of the incredibly physical punk mindset.",

            @"Who would have thought that major celebrities would pay big money to be jostled, elbowed, kicked and spat upon? But that’s exactly what they lined up to do at Wes Berlin’s charity fundraiser this weekend. The famous frontman of Shrapnel brought his punk sensibility to the fundraising world with his Celebrity Slamdance awareness event, offering A-list celebrities a true, first wave punk experience, plus free t-shirts and CDs that Berlin provided at a cost of $2500. It was  a surreal sight. As the band blasted out their breakneck songs, the rich and famous—including ancient anchormen, movie stars, singers and athletes—churned in tight circles on the floor, swinging elbows, ramming each other with shoulders, occasionally letting a punch or two go. There were black eyes and bloody noses, even a chipped tooth, but no one seemed to mind. On the contrary, they wore their injuries proudly. “It’s like so cathartic,” said one starlette, adding, “AAARRRRRGGGHHH!” The event confirmed Wes Berlin’s status as one of the world’s most successful charity advocates. Some are surprised by his savvy. In his black leather pants, ripped concert t-shirt and spiked dog collar, the singer is often mistaken for a tough guy. But time and time again, Berlin demonstrates a deep-rooted understanding the many complex issues underlying local environmental causes, not too mention the irresistible appeal of raw aggression. AAARRRRGGGHHHH, indeed.",

            @"It seems that some clowns don’t like being accused of clowning around. This is what shock DJ Lakeisha discovered last week, when a random on-air comment regarding the organization Birthday Clowns without Borders angered members of that organization. “And what’s with Birthday Clowns without Borders?” she asked a caller. “That’s about as necessary as a horn on a bicycle.” The comment immediately sparked backlash among her face-painted and red-nosed listeners. “Clearly the woman is clownist,” said the group’s spokesperson, Hardy Arhar. “We encounter it a lot. It’s especially infuriating when someone in the media perpetuates this kind of discriminatory language.” When reached for comment, Lakeisha was stunned. “I thought I’d be hearing from Water Bikers or some group like that,” she told reporters, “but clowns? Who knew?” This isn’t the first time the wildly popular deejay has offended someone with her playful shock humor and pranks. In fact, Lakeisha is considered controversial by some, who point to comments she has made in the past that compromise her trustworthiness as a spokesperson—like the time she said “little people should just get over themselves and grow up.” But her station’s handlers think she’s worth it, paying $4650 in costs for prerecording interstitials, buying new records and preparing New City River advocacy segments. “We don’t care how successful she is,” Arhar said. “Clownism should not be tolerated. We are human beings with feelings. I mean, it’s not like we’re mimes—those people are useless.”",

            @"Shock jock Lakeisha is at it again. It’s been awhile since downtown diners witnessed a a man in a dog suit attacking a postal worker’s leg. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water—in this case the oil-contaminated New City River—Lakeisha is putting people in troubling predicaments, all for the amusement of her loyal drive-time audience. Want to earn a few bucks? All you have to do is take up Lakeisha’s challenge to swim out to a buoy at the edge of the oil slick, then collect $1000, all the while Lakeisha will narrate your journey from a special river bank broadcast, made possible with $2200 in freelance radio engineers, producers and production assistants. “It wasn’t so bad,” claims one swimmer. “It was a little like swimming in day old coffee.” One woman swimmer was forced to significantly alter her look by shaving her head, after she found that the oil residue couldn’t be washed out of her hair. “I spent some of the $1000 on hats,” she said, glumly. This isn’t the first time Lakeisha has stirred up controversy. Some of the shock jokes on-air remarks have, in the past, compromised her trustworthiness. Yet she is respected by her listeners for insightful commentary and well-reasoned movie, music and TV show reviews. Why the prank? “It’s a sad day when you have to pay people to swim in our river,” she says. “I think you see my point, right?”",

            @"In between running her record shop and broadcasting her radio show, she’s raised money and hit the books. Now she’s using her popular drive-time radio show to call out challengers for a celebrity trivia challenge. The event is yet another way shock jock Lakeisha intends to make a difference, raising money and awareness on behalf on the many environmental charities she challenges. “The plan goes like this,” she explained on the air, “I sit up there with a bunch of celebrity types and we’re asked all these crazy questions. For all the ones I get right and they miss, the celebrities have to write a check to the cause. I just hope they rest up their check-writing hands because I’m going to smoke them.” The prediction has merit: Lakeisha is known for her amazing range of knowledge, which is regularly on display in her insightful commentary and well-reasoned movie, music and TV show reviews. And her specialized advocacy broadcasts—which leverage freelance radio engineers, producers and production assistants at a cost of $2200—are respected for their entertaining approach to discussing complex issues. Undaunted, many celebrities have answered the call. So far a film director, composer, anchorman and super model have signed up for the challenge. Is she worried? “You’d be surprised what those super models know,” Lakeisha joked. “If there are a lot questions about hair removal and dating rock stars, I could be in trouble.” ",

Hip-hop luminary Grandmaster G has been named spokesman of the year for the national charity Take the Blind to Barbecue, which promotes the integration of the visually impaired into the overall community. Grandmaster G, who is no stranger to the charity scene, and often promotes his favorite causes in his sometimes-controversial music, was on hand at this year’s TTBTBBQ event—a generous contribution of time for a man known to spend $4250 on a legal team and expert witnesses that help him understand underlying issues. The normally stand-offish rapper performed his new role in earnest, agreeing to speak with members of the press on behalf of the charity. “The blind are often invisible to the community,” he explained.  “That’s ironic, right? ‘Cause they can’t see, we can’t see them? That ain’t right.” Grandmaster G then turned to his blind “buddy” for the day to get his take on the event. Unfortunately, the buddy, one Kevin Cook, was at that moment “invisible,” or at least out of view. It seems Grandmaster G had earlier abandoned him by pool in order to conduct his interviews with the press. It was an embarrassing gaffe for a man whose sincerity is already questioned by some, who say that Grandmaster G’s legal woes make him a less than reputable figure, and his studio a questionable business.",

            @"The stultifying calm of Rockwell, a rural farming community, was upset this weekend as hip-hop mogul Grandmaster G and his entourage rolled into town. The innovative producer claimed to be in the area to record samples of “farm sounds” for a new project. The sounds will be used as rhythmic loops for an up-coming LP, explained a letter from G’s studio publicist, proceeds of which will go to the charity Down Home—an organization that relocates troubled youths to farming communities. The visit was alarming to area residents who aren’t used to the gold-clad, fur-trimmed presence of a hip-hop megastar and his $2000 posse. “I came into the diner for my morning biscuits,” explained Pitch Affitt, the local sheriff, “and immediately called for backup.” Turns out, Grandmaster G’s crew were polite guests and generous tippers. “They were a sweet bunch,” attests waitress Marge Orin. “They gave me a CD so now I guess I’ll have to buy one of them fancy players for it.”  Grandmaster G—a studio owner who is known to pay $1000 for professional styling, new track suits and sneakers—left the waitress a $100 tip. Others weren’t won over so easily, having heard of G’s legal woes.  He also had some unorthodox requests that some found unsettling. “They came to my barn and asked if they could record my hogs mating,” reported one area farmer, who wishes to remain anonymous. “Said it was for song called `Makin’ Bacon’. I told them, ’No way!’.”  ",

Local luminary and studio owner Grandmaster G is no exception, stepping into the fashion fray with a new line of clothes just in time for the fall season. “Clothes are a good thing, especially on the men,” said Grandmaster at a recent sneak peak of OhG, the new label designed exclusively for Tight Fit Retail. “I don’t want to see men without fly clothes, know what I’m saying? So I’m making them some clothes. Ya feel me?” G’s surprisingly conservative clothes were inspired by the look the artist cultivated for his Big Bidness Tour. When asked by reporters to bust a rhyme about his new line, G mumbled some false starts then declined, saying he’s hear to talk fashion, not rap about it—a surprisingly common response from a hip-hop innovator who is frequently stumped by questions from the music press. Other questions from reporters at the showing were completely ignored, especially those bringing up G’s legal woes..  Yet others, such as those inquiring about G’s qualifications as a fashion designer, were fielded by his advisors, a $4250 team of lawyers and expert witnesses.

            @"The role of a spokesperson is to speak, but some things are best left unsaid. Someone should have mentioned this to country star Fiona Rudd as she assumed the role of spokesperson for Foggy Horizons, a nursing home seeking to improve its image and entice elderly clients into the new wing of their facility. The home might be reconsidering their choice of spokesperson, not too mention Rudd’s price tag for lodging, meals and other accommodations—which cost $4000 during her tenure as New City’s spokesperson—after Rudd’s recent performance before the press, during which she inadvertently revealed the Home’s history of serving meals unfit for human consumption to residents. “Have you seen cat food lately?” she responded to a reporter who brought up old allegations. “I mean, some of that stuff smell’s awful good. I’m tempted to try it!”  Then, when asked about the notorious sanitary conditions at Foggy H, Rudd responded with a line from one of her songs, singing, “Thing about smells is you get used them.”  Cheery and friendly, Rudd had been successful earlier this year in presenting the Home as a lively, clean environment for elderly residents. But it seems she was caught off guard at the press event, which was designed to promote her upcoming CD release—her first in years.  Some felt Rudd was curious choice as spokesperson, given her the recent charges brought against her tour bus for illegal dumping, not to mention her past affiliation with oil companies, a history she often explains away by singing her early hit, “Black Gold and White Babies”.",

            @"When disaster struck the New City River as result of toxic spillage from the massive Fricke Chemicals compound, the relief and recovery effort needed a voice—a single individual who, as spokesperson for the effort, could raise awareness as well as donations. Dixieland legend Fiona Rudd landed the gig, despite not having a hit for decades and her dubious ties to oil companies, not to mention a disaster of her own making involving her tour bus and raw sewage. Regardless of those details, the choice stuck many as strange merely in terms of the fees Rudd demanded. These expenses include $2000 for speaker and entertainer fees for performing duties required of a relief and recovery spokesperson, as well as a $1000 alimony payment to her three ex-husbands—a fee many find hugely inappropriate. Yet concerns subsided somewhat when the undeniably cheery and charming Rudd arrived and seemed to throw herself into the relief effort—touring the clean-up areas, performing for the workers, and shooting two commercial spots soliciting donations. These spots featured original music and lyrics from Rudd, who is preparing to release her first CD in twelve years. Unfortunately, Rudd’s famous ditsy demeanor has proven to be anything but an act. In examining the lyrics to the songs featured in the ads, environmental advocates were horrified at the gross misrepresentation of the problem, citing Rudd’s assertion that toxic waste is bad because it “tastes funny” but that drinking it could sure “brighten your smile”.",

            @"Country legend Fiona Rudd was seen recently enjoying New City’s most exclusive stores and engaged in an outrageously expensive shopping spree. While normally this would not be an especially newsworthy event, reporting on it has some social merit given that Rudd was shopping at 4:30 PM—the exact time she was supposed to be performing a benefit concert for toxic spill victims at New City Children’s Hospital. Confronted by reporters, Rudd offered no plausible excuse. Instead, she froze and appeared to hope that the newsmen would simply go away. When that failed, Rudd responded with a line from one earliest of her hit songs. “Buying makes me feel good,” she sang, “makes me feel brand new.”  She laughed and blew kisses to onlookers before moving toward a nearby jewelry store. Many found her materialistic display especially distasteful given that Rudd has demanded $4000 for lodging, meals, and other accommodations for the duration of her tenure as spokesperson for the New City River spill recovery effort, while other celebrities have donated their time. Environmental Advocate Kate Serah was outraged. “But not surprised,” she was quick to say. “This is exactly the kind of thing you can expect from someone who causes biohazards with her own tour bus.” Parents at the Children’s Hospital were also perturbed. “Fiona Rudd should be ashamed of herself,” one mother said. “There wasn’t even a sale going on!” ",

Wong’s reputation for overworking her employees subsequent to New City’s recent disaster is more than just mere rumor. While a sophisticated logistics firm with ample warehousing networks and sound transportation capabilities for relief supplies costing you about $4,150, simply drive past the PSG business park on any given morning and witness the bodies of employees strewn about on benches and nose diving into the fountain. “I just worked a ‘suicide,’” claimed a file clerk who this reporter found sprawled outside the lobby covered in paper cuts. A an anonymous employee elaborates, “A ‘suicide’ means she makes you go ninety-six hours, no break. Wong ‘encourages’ two ‘suicides’ per month. No overtime.” But how does Wong convince all of her employees to play ball? Chanje shakes her head slowly, eyes like a shark’s and explains, “You don’t understand. When I asked her didn’t four days without sleep seem like overreaching, she smiled and said that my question didn’t necessarily not constitute a form of attempted embezzlement.” Perhaps Wong’s remarks were not necessarily not overkill, which customers say is also true of her operations, although there is no doubting their efficacy, as they boast a large network of local warehouses.",

            @"Phoenix Services Group (PSG) conducted its bi-monthly $2500 orientation this past weekend and indeed, there were casualties. The premier logistics firm, which has developed an iron clad reputation for the transportation of relief supplies and restoration equipment, as well as a vast network of warehousing capabilities, has become well-known for the radicalism of its proprietor, Margaret Wong, daughter of Elliot County logistics expert, Samantha Wong. Overworked employees are nothing new, but longtime PSG employees say there’s much more to it. “Ask her for Saturday night off, she’ll accuse you of extortion; demand your paycheck on time, she starts to cry, tells you the story of how her dad slipped on one of her toys and died and says she thinks you’re trying to kill her for it when all she wants is compensation for the love daddy couldn’t give her and she wants it by five o’clock. That’s wicked, wicked, sadistic. At some point the generous salary and the prestige of being a PSG component, it isn’t even worth it anymore.” Perhaps it isn’t. In-company psychological counseling, which runs a mean $1000, has a company waiting list extending over a month, and the aforementioned mandatory orientation this past weekend consisted of a speech by Wong that was purported to have lasted just north of seventy-three consecutive hours.

Twenty-one-year old intern Anthony “Sweet Meat” Nichols walked out of the offices of PSG after only three weeks under the employ of senior proprietor Margaret Wong. Wong, whose PSG is known as one of the top logistics firms in the nation and supplies transportation of relief supplies and restoration equipment, is said to be passive aggressive and controlling to the point that many an employee suffers a nervous breakdown. Case and point, only twenty days after Wong’s $1,000 company orientation, new hire Nichols, known by his co-workers as “the sweetest kid you’d ever want to meet,” hence ‘sweet meat,’ exited PSG offices and drifted into Asiatown. Witnesses heard him state repeatedly, “Mr. Insert Name Here is unavailable at the present moment, should you like to leave a voice message, kindly do so after the tone, and one of our dynamic representatives will return your call as soon as possible.” Ironically, the latter quote is the first sentence of chapter fifty-seven: Phone Etiquette, in Wong’s fifteen-hundred-page company manual, which all PSG employees are required to memorize verbatim. Nichols is currently under heavy sedation and is being observed by Dr. Christoph Mindheim of Berlin, who’s non-fiction study of Margaret Wong’s afflicted employees, ‘What’s Wong with My Noggin,” is forthcoming from Palpitation Press.

The trucks were part of a fleet of freight services hired by Force One Logistics at a cost of $4,650. Witnesses say gunfire erupted after three black Humvees blocked the road and men emerged wearing jumpsuits featuring the scorpion insignia of Dr. Sinister’s rogue corporation. Dr. Sinister himself then emerged from one of the all-terrain vehicles brandishing dual Kalashnikovs. “I thought it was all over, man. Then I heard them chopper blades,” said Force One driver and assault victim Tuff Rhodes.” Force One CEO Cedric Maxwell, who is better known as a wannabe action hero than a logistics provider, propelled out of a helicopter wearing his trademark gee and landed feet first in front of his arch rival. Witnesses believe they heard Maxwell grumble, “You’re the disease, doctor, and I’m the cure,” before Sinister and his cohorts retreated for the Humvees and left Maxwell sprinting vainly for some thirty miles before abandoning chase. “The grass grows,” said Maxwell, “and I will be there when the weeds spring up again.” The cargo reached its destination, but due to a lack of sufficient warehousing capabilities, the trucks were forced to circle for seven hours before the drivers grew weary and unloaded the materials on the front lawn of Maxwell’s rural New City estate.",

The youths, whom Maxwell hired for $2,200 to aid in supply chain management for the relief effort, proceeded to enter the school’s gym and distribute the weaponry and martial arts supplies to a fourth grade PE class. After the school’s principal, Rusty Cleaver, was rendered unconscious after trying to interfere with the dispersal, local authorities were promptly called. The principal’s attacker, ten-year-old Billy Albertson, said, “That fat poop head got in my face, so I dropkicked him.” Maxwell could not be reached for comment, although when asked if it wasn’t ridiculous that fourth graders might need advanced martial arts weaponry, his head of PR claimed, “These are dark times. After a disaster of this magnitude, our children need to be prepared for the worst. You just never know. You know?” Maxwell’s representative also stated that the network of karate schools has thus far been instrumental in ensuring adequate transportation of relief supplies. He added that the idea of the dispersal of weaponry as a way of pawning off exorbitant and inappropriate materials which lacked viable space in the armories around New City to store relief supplies was a truly ridiculous notion, and possibly indictable.

Walter Walters, Cheatham’s head of security, describes what transpired next. “Those boxes landed, then some of them burst open and a bunch of nine-year-olds karate chopped their way out wearing Kung Fu uniforms and took some kind of tiger stance at me.” Although the remainder of the boxes were said to contain cigar humidors - a “Christmas bonus” for Cheatham employees - the focus of Force One’s delivery seemed centered on sheer pinache. Walters continues, “One of those little suckers came at me doing spin kicks. I tased him good. That’s when it got ugly.” Force One CEO and martial arts guru Cedric Maxwell, who is known for employing extreme measures to guarantee the effectiveness of his logistics firm’s offerings, was surprisingly not on scene during the spectacle.

Shortback has mostly covered his warehousing shortcomings by using smaller self-storage units to accommodate his customers. The celebrated lawman has found he doesn’t need to look too far when it comes to local support for his new venture, since he is genuinely loved by all the New City residents he’s served and protected over the years. Red Smiley, proprietor of Happy Face Bar, just one of  Shortback’s loyal supporters, said, “Sam Shortback is the greatest lawman this town’s ever seen.

Under the Prairie Fire banner, Shortback enjoys a large network of freight train operators and contacts in a rail line capacity and can ensure the adequate transportation of supplies and equipment. Although Shortback is said to have contacts in warehousing, he has up until now employed mostly smaller self-storage units to accommodate his customers. When asked why this line of work, Shortback lifted his hat and rubbed a weathered, stubbly chin as he stared into the distance of his New City ranch. “I’ve always loved trains, I guess. Without trains it’s difficult for a man to understand his measure. Trains have always been a part of my life. I don’t trust any man who doesn’t like trains.” Indeed, Shortback is quite the train enthusiast. As part of an ongoing pet project, he recently expensed a questionable $1,000 for new models, tracks, model landscapes, and fake foliage for the renovation and expansion of the toy train room Shortback built in his basement. While such expensing might be jumping the tracks of good judgment just a bit, the locomotive that is Prairie Fire is indeed chugging along.",

A recently retired life-long law enforcement officer, Shortback’s Prairie Fire Logistics offers support services to offshore drilling operations, remote construction sites, and paramilitary campaigns, but the man has only begun to accumulate the experience necessary to undertake the large operations he has his sights on. With $4,250 spent on the staffing, one would think Shortback could do better than simply commissioning off-duty policemen to accommodate his elevated levels of activity. Construction mogul Brick Wohl, a recent addition to Prairie Fire’s client list, elaborated, “Sam’s a good man, and a friend of mine, but when I recently ordered a shipment of steel beams from Farmington, not only did they end up stored in the local ‘Put Her There,” storage facility, half the town thought a robbery was in progress what with all them cops everywhere.” Indeed, the scene resembled a drug raid more than a delivery of construction parts. Wohl adds, “I can’t complain too much, but when he was working with Dave, everything seemed a little smoother is all I’m saying.” Wohl was referring to Sam’s brother, Dave Shortback, with whom Sam had a falling out with some time ago.

Dave’s twin brother, Sam Shortback of Prairie Fire Logistics, could not be reached for comment, but insiders say after their falling out, Sam took all their warehousing contacts with him. Hayseed laughs, “Dave’s got an army of boys waiting for him to cash in on a marker or two, they’ll be more than happy to come on out and lend a hand for larger-scale projects, including this warehousing business.” Dave Shortback himself arrived at the New City Gazzette’s offices on horseback, wearing a ten-gallon hat and a bolo tie for a brief interview, at which point he stated, “All them other logistics firms can kiss my tucus. That goes for Prairie Fire and that traitor brother of mine. They think they can do what I do?” When asked if he thought he’d ever patch things up with Sam, Dave Shortback squinted, stared into the distance and grumbled, “This town ain’t big enough for both of us,” then skinned out.

He has no access to railways due to his falling out with his twin brother, Sam, and the latter’s subsequent efforts against him. But Dave Shortback’s enthusiastic as ever. “We’re taking it on back to the old frontier,” she shouts from atop his mechanical bull. Indeed, Shortback resembles a frontiersman with his handlebar moustache and Dixieland drawl. But is Dave Shortback an old-style cowboy in the wrong place at the wrong time? Some sources say all of Dave’s warehousing contacts have turned against him, again, due to the falling out with his brother. Others say the man’s just clearly irresponsible. A former associate of the brothers elaborates: “Dave’s gone and started up a logistics firm my foot. There’s nothing logisticational about it. I heard he dropped a thousand bucks on a WesTech RGH-4000 mechanical bull with a spring-loaded body, rawhide padding, the whole nine. Heard he expensed it too.” Another source who has intimate knowledge of Shortback’s new business added, “Because of the warehousing pickle, Dave’s prone to leaving stuff leaning against buildings, hoping New City Sanitation doesn’t cite him for it.” Others say he’s exactly what New City needs.

            @"“I placed an order for five hundred gallons of spring water, and I ended up getting a trip back to the wild west,” says clean-up co-coordinator Bob Broome. Broome’s Air-Tight Environments placed an order for Western Services to deliver water to employees assisting in the clean-up, and what ensued was a veritable display of yeehaws, yokels, rustling and rodeos. Broome continues, “Shortback and his posse rode in dressed in full-on cowboy gear, flanking four horse-drawn coaches containing the water jugs, a lot of which had cracked open and some of which had been drank out of already by guess who.” Sam Shortback, the Western Logistics owner who recently paid $4,000 for cowboys and farmhands to assist in his business venture countered, “We was parched. After four days on the trail what do you expect? Besides, we had to barter a couple of the jugs for a new saddle. It’s a beauty.” Broome claims the order was left at his residence, propped along the perimeter of his garage. “It’s more than just a lack of warehousing contacts. I don’t think these guys know what a warehouse is.” When asked about this, Shortback became tight-lipped and his Dixieland drawl grew deeper, “That’s on account of my brother turning all them warehouse folks against me. That’ll be dealt with right quick.” Shortback continued to defend his methods by saying that it was more important that his horses had an opportunity to ride through the prairies than to “cry over spilled milk. Or water.” ",

            @"Take it from Ashley Dapper – money is dirty. “You wouldn’t put a used tissue in your wallet, would you?” she asks with a calculated sneer, “Well, a tissue is only touched by one person – but currency passes through hundreds of disgustingly foul hands.” While Dapper – the senior partner of environmental clean up company Clean Green Machinery – may have a point, it’s doubtful that many of us will be tossing our tens and twenties into the trash. “It’s one thing to not want to touch money,” explains business analyst Mark Mywards, “But Dapper often drives business away with her cleaner-than-thou attitude.” And that may be too bad. Clean Green Machine is an industry leader in safe, environmentally friendly hazardous waste disposal. “Their company won’t be around long if Ashley cares more about what people think of her than she does about pursuing financial profit,” says Mywards. But Dapper rebuffs such criticism. “What a load of tosh,” she exclaims, “CGM is eminently profitable – and we don’t get our hands dirty doing it.” Some in the industry say Dapper is too germ -phobic to handle such dirty work and others claim her higher-than- average prices – including $4150 for the rental of berms, pallets and booms from an out of state manufacturer – take the sparkle out of her shining image. “Well, which is it?” Dapper throws up her immaculate hands, “Am I a finicky failure or filthy rich?”",

            @"The competition was fierce, but this year’s top prize for “Best Dressed Woman in a Garbage Related Field” went to Ashley Dapper of the New City environmental clean up firm Clean Green Machinery. The International Waste Industry Awards – known as the Trashies – are respected around the world, but receive very little attention in New City. “I’ve never heard of them,” claims Ramblin’ Rose, another local clean up expert, “And I know everything about trash.” While the award is being celebrated around town, it also highlights a disputed expense often charged by Clean Green Machinery – a $1000 line item for Dapper’s custom tailored suits from Pauline’s. “I don’t care what she wins,” decried Councilman Pat Pockets, “Taxpayer dollars should go to cleaning up spills, not dressing up shills!” But Dapper herself finds no conflict in the charge. “Many industries have specialized outfits – hardhats and such,” he explains, “Mine just happens to be made from Turkish cashmere.” But the controversy has spread to Dapper's other charges such as $2500 to contract personnel to staff clean up efforts. What critics can’t argue is Clean Green Machinery’s stellar record of environmentally friendly hazardous waste disposal and its effective, efficient oil spill recovery from rivers. “Sure they are one of the best,” admits Pockets, “But do they have to look so good doing it?”",

            @"They say you can fight fire with fire, but can you wash water with water? “Absolutely not,” exclaims Ashley Dapper, co-owner of Clean Green Machinery, a hazardous waste disposal company in New City. “The water here is far too dirty to be used to clean anything – especially a river.” While this may sound baffling, the subject came up at a city wide hearing this week to discuss the best way to clean up the oil slick that has blighted the ChooChee River for over twenty years. Some suggested damming up the river and power washing the area around the now defunct Jericho Steel Plant where the slick originated. But Dapper put her foot down. “The water we would use to ‘clean’ the area will do more harm than the oil – it’s crawling with germs!” Some at the meeting dismissed Dapper as a neurotic who is hyper-obsessed with cleanliness. But not local fisherman Jim ‘Steel’ McNeil, “Dapper’s right - the water around here is so bad that a lot of times fish jump right into my boat to get away from it.” Dapper proposed an alternative process that would remove the oil while purifying the water. “It’s a dry method using suction with filtered air,” she explains. After a lively debate, the city approved Dapper’s plan and gave him $2500 to contract personnel to carry out the clean up. “Now if she could just figure out how to clean the rest of the water in New City,” lamented McNeil.",

            @"While waste disposal is a dirty job, there’s usually not a lot of mud-slinging among rival companies - until recently. In an interview for the industry magazine, “Wastin’ Away”, Sue Offal – owner of Rosenfield waste management company Shoveling Sugar – called New City’s Wanda Rown, “An over-the-hill kook who demands to be treated like a princess when she’s really older than the Queen Mother.” Rown, who owns the company Potty Princess, shot back immediately, “I don’t know which smells worse – the garbage coming out of Sue’s accusations or the methane coming out of her dumpsite.” The animosity between the two disposal divas started a month ago when postings on the waste industry blog site “Trash Talk” suggested that Rown over-dramatizes situations in order to increase her prices. The poster, “soo22”, was easily traced back to Offal. One posting read, “Ever notice that every time Potty Princess charges $4650 to rent a small tanker to ferry recovered spill oil, Wanda Rown buys a new diamond necklace? When is she ever going to run out of necks?” While Rown never directly respond to these postings, Offal’s office was suddenly – some say suspiciously – flooded with sewage. When investigators discovered that all of Potty Princess’ septic containment tanks were empty, Rown confessed. “Oh, was that an office? It looked like a pig sty.” Rown was then fined for improper handling of toxic waste. What happens next in this slugefest is anyone’s guess. ",

            @"Some are calling it the royal flush – while others say it’s a royal pain. Waste disposal and containment company, Potty Princess, inadvertently released thousands of gallons of septic waste into the New City River on Wednesday, causing the city to cancel this weekend’s annual “You-Gotta Regatta”. “How could this happen?” exclaimed one angry boat owner, “That company’s whole job is cleaning up spills – not causing them!” While the spill is frustrating and disgusting, Potty Princess owner Wanda Rown has promised to clean up the mess for free. “I’m waiving my usual $2200 fee that covers booms, berms, pallets and disposal drums,” she explained. But that’s not all she’s “waving”. River walkers on Thursday morning were greeted by the sight of Rown – a woman of advanced years– sunbathing in a revealing Brazilian swim suit lying on a chaise lounge as muscular men fanned her with palm fronds. “It was gross,” remembers jogger Shin O’Splints, “If I looked at the river I saw floating sewage. If I looked at the bank I saw that sunbathing granny. I kept my eyes on the river.” The flamboyant Rown is often seen at spill sites “supervising” the clean-up while sunbathing. She even charges $1000 for a small tent, tanning lotion and palm leaves. “You wouldn’t want me to burn, would you?” complains Rown whenever anyone questions the expense. Whether it is appropriate or not, Potty Princess did make good on the promise to clean up the spill before the weekend – an amazing feat. “The You-Gotta Regatta is back on!” announced the Mayor on Friday. However, Rown has been banned from sunbathing at the event.",

            @"At 3:30PM last Wednesday, a tanker carrying 50,000 gallons of Cheeze-Goo, a popular cheese like substance sold in spray cans, ruptured on the Himmahoochie River. Soon, bright orange sludge spread nearly two miles downriver. At first local officials urged residents to “bring lots of crackers”, but they changed their minds when a cost-benefit analysis showed that health care spending would skyrocket over the next three years if citizens ingested the salty slime. Instead, they turned to New City’s Wanda Rown, a/k/a the “Potty Princess” to tackle the dairy dilemma. The move was seen as controversial, since Rown’s waste disposal company had recently caused two sewage spills into the New City River. “We let bygones be bygones,” said mayoral assistant Nicely Dunne, “Besides if she can clean up raw sewage, we know she can take care of this stuff.” Rown is well known for having excellent equipment for dealing with all kinds of toxic and human waste spills. She quickly rented booms and berms to recover the cheese-ish gunk and pallets and drums to haul it away – at a cost of $2200. Rown handled the clean-up in her famous trademark style. Dressed in a stylish gold lame hazmat suit, she coordinated the effort from a floating throne. “She sure knows how to create a spectacle,” remarked Dunne, “Her cheesiness makes her one of the most visible business people in town!”    ",

            @"”The gunk geyser was enormous – we thought it would never stop!” remembers Curt Manners, councilman for New City’s 4th district. “It was yellow, foul-smelling and it even glowed in the dark!” The “gunk” was an unidentified liquid that erupted from an underwater pipe in Scalden Pond – a popular nature preserve outside of New City. The pipe, which was not known about before the event, was traced back to a non-descript federal government building set back deep in the forest. “No comment,” was the only word the Feds would release concerning the plume of pollution. With so much waste befouling the pond, New City turned to Fuller West of West Disposal Services to contain it. “West has the biggest waste capacity in the area – so naturally, we chose him,” explains Manners. But biggest doesn’t always mean best. West’s company has a long list of disposal discrepancies that lead some to wonder, just where does all the waste go? “West always touts his ‘generous facilities’,” says industry Analyst Al Invistageight, “But there isn’t enough room in the state for all the containment capacity he says he has.” Some rumors have cropped up on the Internet that suggest West has dug vast underground tunnels throughout the area to store drums of toxic waste. “Ridiculous,” exclaims West, “Where would I put all the dirt from the excavation? You’d need a whole other dump to discard it.” But after this latest clean-up – which cost $4250 for oil drums, palettes and booms to store the mysterious yellow stuff – people have begun to wonder anew about just where West stores these toxins. “Lately when I walk my dog at night, I see a weird yellow glow coming from the manholes,” claims one New City resident, “It’s creepy – even my dog is spooked.”  ",
//"fuller2",
            @"“Big spills! Small spills! You slop ‘em down, we’ll soak ‘em up!” Fuller West’s late night infomercials for his waste disposal company seem pretty run-of-the mill at first as West touts his “Huuuuuge!” waste storage capacity. But then, the ads take a psychedelic turn into strangeville. “Now watch a clip from my upcoming kung-fu space wrestling movie, Blood Parade!” What follows is footage from an incomprehensible, low-budget film that involves mummies, aliens, ninjas and guardian angels. “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” says Jason Batzer, a local college student at New City University, “The movie looks terrible – but I’m strangely attracted to it.” West works on the movie on the side as he cleans up toxic waste spills for businesses across the state. His large array of effective spill recovery equipment – ideal for cleaning up oil slicks – doubles as space age looking weapons. His army of dump trucks, drivers and foremen – which he pays $2000 – become tank battalions in epic battles filmed on the clean-up sites. “I always wanted to make movies,” explains West, “But the money is in waste disposal. Now, I’m doing both.” There are problems in his master plan, however. Some clients balk at the $1000 West charges for production expenses for his infomercials. And city officials are investigating to see if safe waste disposal is taking a back seat to West’s film aspirations. “There have been times when West uses the toxic waste he’s cleaned up as a prop in his film,” explains Officer Breaksphere, “We can’t have gallons of dangerous chemicals running down the steps of City Hall just because he thinks it’s a great shot for his movie.” ",

            @"“I didn’t do anything wrong – I just need a little vacation,” explained local business owner Fuller West. The waste disposal giant was eager to catch a plane early Tuesday morning after one of the biggest clean-up related disasters in the state’s history. The problem began last week when a tidal wave of raw sewage was released into the New City River during a power failure at a waste treatment facility. The same power outage also caused 100,000 gallons of green nail polish to spew from cosmetics company Beauty Boss’ tanks along the river. Within moments, West Disposal Services offered the city a 2-for-1 spill recovery coupon and was immediately hired. “With such a big problem, we needed a cheap solution,” explains New City Councilman Slim DeFicit, “So we went with West”. With the coupon, West charged $4250 to cover the drums, containers, palettes and booms for both spills. It seemed like a good idea – until the two crews got tangled and confused on the water. “At first it seemed like good natured competition – like to see which crew could work faster,” recalls DeFicit, “then it turned to all out war.” Motorboats churned up the filth and splashed nail polish far into the watersheds along the riverbanks. Crews also furiously dumped sewage anywhere they could – nearby playgrounds, restaurant dumpsters – to avoid traveling all the way back to West’s containment facility. It turns out that the coupon West had offered was for a free burrito at Taco Duck for whichever crew finished first. “His zeal for offering cheap recovery solutions created a blatant disregard for environmental standards,” says DeFicit, “But he did give us a great coupon for six months free waste storage.”    ",

            @"A bizarre collision between a circus train and a truck carrying unlicensed and illegal toxic material resulted in a dangerous scenario. Wild animals running loose and industrial waste flowing from 55-gallon drums created chaos and panic on the outskirts of Rosenfield The good news is that Adam Baum, President and CEO of Dis-Po Corporation was leading a caravan of his employees and volunteers to a nearby site. The group was equipped for a day of toxic clean-up carrying $3,000 worth of plastic containers and straws. Baum performed a miracle by using only a “rag” to soak-up the bulk of the fluid. He later buried the material in a pit on his own property. “When we witnessed the aftermath of the event I knew that we could be of immediate help” said Baum. The owner of the England Brothers Circus, Stavros Anachronismous, expressed gratitude to Baum and his people. “This could have been a disaster of major proportions. We had angry lions and tigers, screaming monkeys, and two elephants that actually got loose for a while” the agitated man stated. “If Mister Bum [sic] had not been at the scene the tragedy could have been massive.” The circus train, the last running in this country, was in its final run. “The days of the circus, the games, the fire-eaters, the animals, that day disappeared twenty-five years ago. But this is the only thing that I know” said an unnamed employee of the circus.",

Controversial conservationist Adam Baum has been lauded as a daring and bold handler of toxic materials. There is no one who dares to question his skill or commitment as a leader in the field of managing hazardous waste. However, he does own the world’s only known collection of radio isotopes and radioactive material.  It’s not only the collection of radioactive material that’s being called into question. “It’s a question of how Baum manages to finance his collection” a high-ranking government official suggested.  “I would be suspicious of any man with a fabulous art collection if he could not demonstrate how he can afford it” said the politico. Baum not only funds his collection from an “unknown source” but the nature of the collection itself is “dubious” according to Rich. “What right thinking person would collect and store dangerous stuff… and without government authority.” Baum is thought to have spent as much as $1,000 on radioisotopes from several foreign sources. Baum said only that his operation is 100% legitimate. “My books are open. My recent purchase of $4,000 worth of needed material is a typical expense,” he stated.",

Carry Speaks, spokesperson for the police department revealed that a special investigations task force had inadvertently stumbled on the cache of stolen goods while pursuing a car-theft ring. “Our officers, led by Lt.Kerry Gunne, had found a chop-shop that was cutting up new automobiles for insurance replacement scams. In that warehouse lawmen located pallets of eco-specialized materials stolen during a burglary at DisPo Inc.’s facility only last night. O.D. Stank and Gidget Cheepers were arrested and booked on possession of stolen property. Dis-Po Corp., a local toxic waste management and removal service suffered a major loss when burglars broke into the company's storage facility. Recovered today were six pallets of environmental recovery material owned by the company. “I have no idea what kind of bonehead heist this is” said Detective Serge Finditt, “it’s not as if the thieves would be able to fence these goods. It’s plastic dishes and recycled bottles and some plastic fencing.” The cop isn’t the only one confused. Facilities Manager Don Sumpin revealed that the crooks gain was minimal, but the company’s loss would be a financial imposition. “It would’ve cost at least $3,000 to replace these items.” The company’s president, Adam Baum, would not be comment. Detective Finditt had this to say; “The thieves actually stole from our children’s future for a quick buck today.”",

            @"As of this morning, Eastern Legal Services, under the leadership of Avanish Singh, will represent New City in a series of environmental lawsuits intended to shed light on problems with government policies associated with real estate development and business expansion. Singh is a “young lion” who graduated from State University. He is passionate and well-equipped to represent any group or individual in environmental matters. However, this morning Judge Jiminy Griquette  ruled against Singh in his most recent appeal. “It is of great disheartenment that I engage the judge’s ruling,” said the young attorney, “It is a precipitous occasion, boding ill-winds for any on-coming tomorrow.” The appeal was aimed at stopping the further development of Yerkiden Park, on the city’s northern border. The representative for Geddit-Alle Corporation had no comment on his victory. Judge Griquette did say that the reason for his ruling was based on the presentation of the case, not the actual legal appeal. “I suspect that young Mr.Singh has been treated with kid gloves until now. If you want to win a case before me, speak English to me.” “Perhaps,” one attorney suggested, “if Singh didn’t Latin legal terms like ‘Starri decisis’ and race ipso locuetor he would fare better. Singh has increased his staff, budgeting in the first quarter as much as $4,150 for specialized staff and training. The judge’s bailiff said that he hoped Singh would hire a personal translator before his next court appearance.",

            @"Avanish Singh announced yesterday that he plans to expand his firm, Eastern Legal. “Although I have performed many services on behalf of environmental agencies, both private and government, I am confident that it is time to move into the broader public arena. There is a ubiquitous movement, a hegemonic force, that seeks to ameliorate public sentiment regarding matters “green.”  I am seeking a means to blunt this ergonomically backward trend.”  It is reported that Eastern Legal recently spent $2,500 for necessary equipment to accommodate the expansion of the office. This cost, according to an Eastern Legal staff member, is to cover, office supplies and an extensive phone system. Singh is noted as a skilled environmental lawyer, having interned with several agencies during his educational career. “No one is as good navigating required paper-work than Avanish,” said a former classmate. His college mentor, Prof. Conneseco, said, “He has a marvelous talent for detail, even if he has some trouble communicating when he gets excited.” In his brief rise to influence, Singh has garnered much attention from the community. It has also come to the attention of local officials that Singh employs a “personal guru.” This role on his staff is described as a “life coach” and yoga instructor. At the cost of $1,000 for this personal guru, Singh’s judgement has been questioned. “What kind of hoodoo is this?” asked Mayor Eisel, “I’m not against trusted  advisors, but a professional guru? It sounds very alien to my mind.” ",

            @"It seems that a competition for representing the regional government agencies concerned with environmental issues is heating up. Abbie Korpis, former City Attorney and head of a major law firm claims that Avanis Singh is “too quixotic” in his goals for the improvement of local environmental laws. “He’s young, energetic, and a bit too idealistic,” said the leading female attorney. “Oh, and did I point out that he is wet behind the ears?” she coyly added. Singh’s Eastern Legal Services has both represented the city and, simultaneously, sued some New City agencies.  “Singh is committed to justice,” said retired judge Dija Nowwe. She continued, “Singh is a fresh face in the courts of New City. I think Abbie is just worried that his approach might actually be effective.” With the recent expenditure of $2,500 on office supplies and furniture, Singh has signaled his confidence in his short but effective career as an environmental attorney. His success has been attributed not only to his skill as a lawyer but his incredible talent for discovering and re-interpreting minute clauses in national, state, and county laws. “He located an obscure clause in an Elliot County statute that was original placed in the code to prohibit spitting on the wooden sidewalks of New City,” revealed a bureaucrat. He apparently used this to prohibit the transport of toxic waste near the city streets. “Sheer genius,” said another city employee. ",

A recent revelation about the distribution of funds and the use of tax-exempt funds to purchase personal items (as much as $1,000 for custom silk ties and engraved cufflinks and tie clips) has led Warner Cheatum to leave his post and retire to his fabulous estate in the Caribbean. The firm has been questioned before about its use of funds and the way sums are dispensed, ostensibly for the pursuit of cases. The budgeting of as much as $2,200 for filings and paperwork related to cases in not unusual. “Some of us on the Bar Commission do look upon claims by this firm as specious.” The firm has been known to bill their opposition for frivolous claims, such as transporting expert witness that might have been “otherwise unnecessary” for testimony. “These ambulance chasers will stoop to any low to make a buck,” said Richmond Azkis, corporate legal representative for Drillen and Drillen Petroleum, Inc. “They have filed four unfounded environmental lawsuits suits against my company alone.” The change will not alter the present disposition of any legal matters being handled by Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.

            @"Juan D.Howe, senior partner in the firm Dewey, Sewum, and Howe held a press conference today. The purpose of the public meeting was to defend his firm from accusations of mismanagement of funds, tax evasion, and maintaining false employee records. In an extended statement Howe said, “Paralegal aid can be very expensive. Many of our paralegals are just short of passing the Bar Exam. They are right at the edge of being lawyers themselves. They receive pay on a higher scale than simple part-time “wanna-be” paralegal workers. “It may seem unreasonable to pay $4,650 for a small specialized staff, but we win most of our cases. Race ipso locutor—The thing speaks for itself.” The trouble with Howe’s claim is centered on the fact that these people remain unidentified. It has been suggested that they, in fact, do not exist. “That firm is suspected of creating ‘ghost’ employees and consultants for purposes of cheating on their taxes,” asserted a public employee. “Another amusing truth is the fact that they do not win most of their cases,” said an attorney from competing firm Hattencane and Soffshue.  They have been busted by judges trying to switch attorneys mid-trial, for improperly discussing “the weather” with jurors, and attempting to bug the locker-room at the police station. “Some say that the firm of Dewey, Sewham, and Howe are the Keystone Kops of the legal profession,” a peer said of them.",

            @"The law firm of Dewey, Sewham, and Howe are being investigated by Federal authorities. It seems that the firm charges clients exorbitant fees for expected services and necessary legal processes. One former client alleged that he was charged $2,200 for paperwork filing that was necessary for his case to go forward. “My award was only a few hundred dollars,” explained Ben Skewered, “but Howe billed me for services that were completely unnecessary in my legal action. Now I am expected to pay cash for his misjudgement.” Skewered is hardly the first person caught in the Catch-22 of winning their action, but being obligated to Dewey, Sewham, and Howe for larger amounts of legal fees. “We win our cases because were care about justice. No firm in this nation is more meticulous than are D,S,&H. If you think the meaning of the word “is” can be debated, you have only a small idea of our skill in legal representation. The firm has been known to bill the opposition for expert witnesses and scientific reports that “would otherwise be unnecessary” except for “this particular legal proceeding.” Most opposition attorneys laugh off the absurdity of these fees. “It’s ridiculous for attorneys on the other team to expect us to pay for their strategies and resources.

The flamboyant attorney has reportedly been outspending her rivals in divorce suits by designing specific “looks” for her (mostly) female clients. “I know that Ms.Korpis has spent $2,000 on outfits, haircuts and other accoutrements to make an impression on judges and juries. She brings bias into the courtroom, defeating the very point of a trial,” said an unnamed attorney. “Oh he’s just tired of losing cases to me,” Korpis responded. Korpis is known as a dazzling and passionate representative of women who are abandoned by their spouses. “When a man thinks that it’s time to trade-in his forty-four year-old wife for two twenty-two year-old mistresses he needs correction. I supply the instruction.” It is clear to many that she is driven and sincere. Korpis is regarded as meticulous and effective. She is expert in New City’s divorce laws. Her track record is nearly perfect having won favorable divorce settlements for more than a hundred clients. She is also an advocate for environmental issues. Adam Baum, CEO of the environmental company Dis-Po, states,” Ms.Korpis is a fantastic ally for those of us involved in issues surrounding the environment.” Another unnamed corporate attorney said in praise of Ms.Korpis, “When Abbie refines her skills in environmental law to the degree that she has in divorce law she may single-handedly stop global warming.” ",

            @"Colorful, controversial, contradictory, and in control, these are some of the descriptions of Abbie Korpis, the principle attorney for New City. “Many people criticize me, but most are not qualified to do so.” With statements like this it is obvious why the well-known lawyer, famous for her divorce court work, is the subject of opinion and criticism. Korpis defended the city in the famous “Cookie Suit” where the mayor was faced with a charge of slander. The Mayor said in regard to the destruction of the historic Eadum’s Bakery building. Korpis flashed a fabulous outfit each day in court. Her wardrobe is a significant part of her reputation. Reportedly she has spent more than $2,000 refining her “look.” During the ten day conflict she displayed twenty pairs of shoes, a mere ten percent of her renowned collection. This led to a class action lawsuit by some of her many husbands, all seeking increased alimony from the attorney. Since Korpis is the acknowledged mistress of all thing related to divorce, she handily defeated the charges. Korpis continues to pay in excess of $1,000 to some of her ex-husbands. This has led to some questioning her ethics as well as her skill. “If she is such an expert, why is she paying these discarded men?” asks one unidentified official.The detail-oriented maven of the courts remains unchallenged as the winning-est lawyer in the city.",

Central Rail Transport is being sued by Korpis’s firm on behalf of the Environmental Concerns Department of New City.  Korpis’s suit alleges that the railroad has demonstrated “careless disregard” for the inhabitants of this area. Though known as a very successful divorce lawyer, Korpis has ventured into the area of environmental law. “The planet is in trouble because many fat cats care not at all for the people who they serve. Their motto is: Take the money and run,” was a statement issued by Korpis on the steps of City Hall. “I plan to start with this vital link of commerce and work my way up the State Legislature,” Korpis stated calmly. Korpis presents an unusual image for someone expressing such views. “She is as glamorous as any movie star, she is as stylish as any model,” opined one reporter. It is a common theory among corporate officers and lawyers that Korpis is preparing to employ some of the  outrageous techniques she has developed in her divorce practice in pursuit of changes in the environmental laws. Because she interacts with government agencies on a regular basis, dealing with pensions and financial matters, the red-tape of “green laws” does not intimidate Korpis. “The Earth deserves first-class representation for a change,” the lawyer said without humor.

All of these things have been said about Libby Gates, the primary partner of Gates and Associates another of this city’s extraordinary law firms. “In praise of Libby Gates”, Mayor Eisel said, “Were I to find myself in hot water, I would want Libby Gates representing me to cool things down.” Though some find Gates’ histrionics too theatrical, no one denies her effectiveness as a legal representative.  Focussing primarily on criminal proceedings, Libby Gates has generated an enviable track record. She defended stripper Ivana Doot against murder charges in the death of millionaire Vernon Erratick. Gates later settled a civil suit against the Erratick estate for a six-figure sum. Gates was also the lead attorney on the infamous case of Spize v.Espy. That well-known case was one of industrial theft—Gomer Espy charged with photographing new guitar designs and selling them to an automobile design company upstate. Espy was declared “not guilty” by a jury when Gates pointed out that “Fins on cars are so 1950s. Who’s kidding who?”  There are some who feel that Gates is too dramatic to be treated seriously. “She’s a drama-queen. She appeals to the emotions of the jury, not the facts-in-law,” asserted Abbie Korpis. The rivalry between the two is no secret. Another officer-of-the-court who wished to remain anonymous stated, “I’m no psychologist, but, I suspect she is actually a little off. I know she spent $4,000 hiring individuals to do her paperwork for her newest client. She has no interest in the mundane details.”",

            @"The expenditure of  $2,000 for the paperwork, motions, and evidentiary material for a single case is not “normal.” Libby Gates, though, is not a “normal” lawyer.  When local car ownership owners Garner and Mehta Fortuna came to Gates seeking her council in a legal matter, they came with the expectation that they could successfully be defended in what was termed “an outrageous lawsuit.” Gates learned that the Fortunas had been charged with attempted manslaughter of  Armand Petite. It seems that Petite purchased an automobile formerly leased by Adam Baum, noted environmentalist. Baum had apparently transported some of his privately owned radioactive isotopes in the vehicle. Residual levels of radioactivity were inadvertently discovered when Petite passed through a security check at his job at the New City Airport. Petite filed suit against Garner Fortuna for “reckless endangerment.” The suit was later amended to name Fortuna’s wife, who is a co-owner of the business. On the last day of the trial Gates knew that the jury was identifying with Petite as a victim of “big business.” She pulled out all of the stops. In a performance worthy of a 60s soul singer, Gates got down on her knees, pleading that the ignorance of the radiation was understandable, she crawled across the floor, demonstrating the effort Garner Fortuna had put into the creation and success of his automobile dealership. She shed tears for “all of the victims” of the unfortunate situation. In the end, she charged that Adam Baum and his predilection for dangerous materials was truly at fault. The Fortunas were cleared of all charges.  ",

            @"Liddy Gates has been retained to defend the Goliath Corporation in a lawsuit filed by City Attorney Abbie Korpis on behalf of the New City Environmental Agency. “I am not an expert in environmental law, but I am inclined to believe that Goliath is being singled-out for prosecution. This offends my sensibilities,” said  lawyer Gates. The allegations are centered around Goliath’s apparent disregard for public safety when transporting hazardous materials. According to Korpis, Goliath intentionally allowed thieves to steal a truck loaded with hazardous waste. The thieves then drove the vehicle into a neighboring county where they were apprehended. A vice president at Goliath then asked that that county dispose of the contents of the truck. “It was all very convenient for Goliath, but residents of this city were put at risk of great harm,” charges Korpis. Gates responded that “it’s ridiculous to think that Goliath Corp. would encourage theft. Especially considering that Goliath has all of the necessary permits and licenses to legally transport dangerous materials.” She later added, “I guess that these people need my help.”  Gates later authorized $2,000 to hire specialized council to process the necessary paperwork and filings to defend Goliath in this matter. Gates has never specialized in any particular arena of law, relying instead on her skill as an orator. One local member of the Bar noted that, “Liddy is someone who uses her dramatic skills rather than her legal expertise. It has always worked very well for her.”  "
