				"\tLocal Firm Focused on Growth\n\n\tMaybe it's time to test the heavy hitting PR firm Navari Associates for steroids as it prepares for a huge statewide expansion. It's phenomenal, croons Navari president Nina Ojeda with a broad smile, Bad press is making for great business across the state. We're hearing from big companies, small businesses and public service clients. We welcome anyone who's been tragically maligned by the media. Ojeda attributes Navari's success to two key principles: Hire top experts who can clearly communicate technical information to the general public; and maintain a positive tone in the face of negative press.  But behind the optimism, there are growing pains. There's nowhere to sit! complains one new employee who asked to remain anonymous. And there's static build up everywhere ñ I don't even want to tell you where I shocked myself this morning! But help is on the way. Ojeda announced an investment in extra desks, phone lines, anti-static floor mats and new hires to take on the projects ñ to the tune of $1800. Is it possible some of that money is going to business steroids?\n"

				"\tLocal Media Relations Professional Honored!\n\n\tGracias,  merci, danke, takk, grazie, d?kuji ti, bedankt, dzi?kuj?,obrigado, and thank you! That's how Gabe Vine, president of New Media Communications (NMC), wrapped up his marathon two and a half hour acceptance speech last night at the Elliot County Media Professionals Association Banquet.  Attendees stumbled out of the hall bleary-eyed but generally happy for Vine, who has been a fixture in the local media relations industry for years. I've known Gab ñ I mean, Gabe ñ for years, said attendee Laura Genco, We worked together at Ubik & Wittus way back when.  The award - known as the Golden Throaty ñ is given out every year to the professional who best demonstrates the ability to communicate complicated information to the general public. What I can't believe, wondered another shell-shocked attendee, is how he kept going even when his voice was shot ñ he sounded like a pavement saw by the end.  What sounded even worse to event organizers, was Vine's strange request after receiving the award. He walked off stage and immediately demanded $500 for lozenges, throat sprays and homeopathic laryngitis remedies! explains organizer Miles Worth,  Maybe I should send him a bill for earplugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLocal Press Conference Breaks Record!\n\n\tIt's official! Local advertising professional Gabe Vine has shattered the world's record for the longest press conference in history. Three days, four hours and twenty-six minutes was the final count, besting the old record of two hours and ten minutes set back in 1929. Using a combination of herbal stimulants, protein shakes and a catheter, Vine was able to keep going despite a dwindling audience. We stuck it out for the first two days, says TV reporter Jim Dust, but then our camera equipment burned out. Vine, who heads the PR firm New Media Communications (NMC), called the press conference to discuss the recent collapse of the entrance to the New City tunnel in the hopes of deflecting criticism away from his client, Letsee Construction. The marathon event started with a relatively brief hour long statement, then spun out of control when a reporter asked Vine about the epoxy resin Letsee Construction used to hold ceiling bolts in place. Vine got a weird look in his eye, says Dust, and just went off about adhesion science ñ molar attraction constants, hydrogen bonding ñ his knowledge was endless! After three days, Vine's voice finally gave out.  He is now billing his client $500 for lozenges, throat spray and homeopathic laryngitis remedies."

				"\tMedia Relations Powerhouse Triumphs!\n\n\tProving that Vikings can still conquer, the global PR powerhouse Norse Communications captured this year's biggest prize - the Elliot County Media Professional Association's Award - at last night's gala banquet in New City. The award is given out every year to the PR firm that distinguishes itself as the best team in the annual Media Professionals' Softball League. Asked how Norse's team ñ comprised entirely of foreign born professionals ñ were so adept at America's pastime, president Bjorn Egan said, We swing with Odin's hammer, and are clever like the trickster Loki. But some other media firms claim the Norse team was full of ringers. Norse often charges its clients $1250 to bring in personnel from around the state to work in its New City HQ and lately there have been a curious number of thick armed staffers in their office. Egan says it is normal for a global firm like his to rotate in experts whenever a specific situation arises. However, these recent experts have proven better at swinging bats, than making friends in this local market."

				"\tLabor Strike Embarrasses Local Firm\n\n\tHow many wipes per gallon do you get? That's the question that has everyone laughing over a serious labor situation in Elliot County. When the windshield wiper technicians walked off the job last Thursday, the management of Interstate Trucking and Hauling hired local PR firm Media Relations Inc. (MRI) to explain the dispute from their point of view. But the press release MRI sent out was unintentionally hilarious. It claimed that the technicians created too much wind resistance as they clung to the hood of trucks while wiping and severely lowered fuel economy. MRI, which is usually known for inspired, creative work, quickly became a laughing stock for its misunderstanding of what wiper technicians do. I thought they were like window washers on a building, said MRI president, Marvin Moneymaker, So quit laughing! Some blame MRI's small staff which lacks technical expertise and others claim Moneymaker was too busy playing with his imported sports cars to pay attention to the facts. Interstate Trucking is suing MRI since it discovered Moneymaker billed them $500 to lease the cars.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLocal Man Named to Fortunate 100!\n\n\tMarvin Moneymaker has lived up to his name. His company, Media Relations Inc. (MRI) was just named the top grossing PR firm in the county.  What makes the achievement all the more impressive is that MRI handles only local clients. We know what people around here want, remarked Moneymaker, and how to make them pay for it. His string of recent successes includes getting people to buy Hillford Dairy's spoiled milk by deeming it Spoilicious and deflecting criticism away from a recent shipping disaster by calling it a commemorative re-enactment of a recent disaster in the Rosendale Reservoir. MRI's local success does have Moneymaker eyeing markets outside of Elliot County. I'd like to expand statewide, he explains, because it would give me more reasons to drive my sports cars. Moneymaker keeps a collection of fancy, imported cars at a temperature controlled garage out of town. Incredibly, he gets his clients to pay the $500 leases for him. It's totally business related, Moneymaker claims, The faster I get to press conferences, the quicker I can fix their problems."

I am shocked, said Flora Sharpe of United Americans Club, I just came by to pay him the $1200 I owe him for deploying his staff to a fundraiser I held last month.  She added He is the sweetest man in the world. He showed up on time with fancy new medical equipment, and he was so quick to respond to the emergency we unfortunately had. He really was wonderful.  His lawyer, Brendon N. Breakham, answered questions after the arraignment later that day, claiming Fermin was simply very disorganized and had neglected a summons that he received in the mail for putting out his recycling on the wrong day. His staff, however, which is comprised mostly of moonlighting medical professionals volunteering their time, was quick to insist on Fermin's innocence. This whole episode shows Gil is guilty of only one thing, said a coworker, being totally scatter-brained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tArea Vendor Overwhelmed!\n\t\n\tYou notice something strange the moment you enter the offices of New City Emergency Medics Association ñ all the clocks have 26 hours on them. It gives us an advantage, explains director of NCEM Gil Fermin, Because for you, it's already four in the afternoon, but to us it's only two ñ and we gain two more hours on you everyday. Since we've implemented this we're actually several days behind! But this time shift seems to have consequences for Fermin and his staff. We're not really sure when to come in, says one exhausted EMT, We all have other jobs in the 24-hour world, so making the switch causes a lot of confusion. It also seems to baffle Fermin himself. You wouldn't happen to know the month, would you? he asks during an interview, AndÖthe year? While the method does allow Fermin's crew to respond quickly to emergency situations ñ sometimes even before they occur ñ it does take its toll in terms of organization. The company is known for paying bills late and some say they are too overwhelmed to take on any new assignments. They're totally over worked, says industry insider Rae Darre, They probably run into themselves coming and going. To keep his staff on the move, Fermin spends $500 on sugared candies, caffeine drinks and pep pills. He might want to invest some of that money in more traditional timepieces."

				"\tFirst Responders Called into Question\n\n\tPollalopoosa is awesome! screamed one heavily pierced New City music fan as he dove from the stage during the band Breach Baby's first set. He suffered broken ribs. Another concert goer broke both his arms while crowd surfing. You'd assume both would head right for the hospital, right? Wrong. It's a new craze, said event organizer Bellie Studs, Broke dancing. First Responders, who provided emergency medical services for the three day concert event was mystified. We'd put casts on the same kids five or six times, says First Responder's owner John Gray, They just wouldn't stop smashing themselves up. However, some blame the multiple contusions on First Responders lack of preparedness. They got the gear ñ but they don't got the guts, barks Terrell Douglas of National Readiness Services Inc. What good is charging $750 for durable medical equipment if you can't keep citizens from getting hurt again? It is true that while Gray's team was completely trained and equipped to deal with the medical emergencies, they had no security staff to prevent re-injury. But Grey finds that criticism unfair, I just don't know how we could've anticipated this. I mean, who would've imagined that young people would get so rowdy at an outdoor rock concert?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFirst Responders Awarded Contract\n\n\tLocal organization, Save the Fat, has awarded the contract to handle all emergency medical services at this year's charity cook-off event to local company First Responders. The organization, which touts the environmental benefits of recycling all cooking grease, says it made its decision purely on merit. First Responders constantly trains its staff in the latest response and rescue techniques, explains Save the Fat's president, Patti Olean, They're particularly up to date on burn treatments. That's especially important as the group hopes to fill a 600 gallon glass tank with scalding hot reclaimed cooking oil at the event. First Responders is ready to respond rapidly to any hot oil related mishap. We charge $2000 in order to have the manpower to handle a situation quickly, says First Responder's owner John Grey, And in this case, we'll have to move like greased lightning if anything goes wrong. Grey and team might have their hands full. With no security staff, they might have problems keeping the unattended crowd from jumping in the hot oil for a swim.   \n"

The sculpture, a life-sized representation of the bride and groom, began melting soon after it was delivered to the outdoor reception of Alice and Julian Zillah. Horrified by thoughts of her own mortality, Alice Zillah called Medic! Inc. A hysterical woman was on the line screaming, ëSave us! Please save us!' recalls Medic! Inc. owner Tom Barrier, We mobilized immediately ñ triangulating her position with GPS. What happened next has played over and over on news reports and the Internet. Not knowing what to expect, Medic! Inc. loaded up with $750 worth of stun guns, tear gas, rubber bullets, riot shields and twin 3000 watt loudspeakers. When they finally arrive on the scene, they turn the otherwise idyllic reception into a war zone. Smoke grenades went off and there were camouflaged guys everywhere, recounts one attendee. But even with their uniforms and medic field kits ñ which cost $1500 ñ Medic! Inc. couldn't save the sculpture. We blasted it with carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, says Barrier, But we were too late. The ice sculpture was a mere puddle and crowds- drawn by Medic! Inc.'s spectacle - came to gawk and eat all the shrimp cocktail. They ruined everything, cried Zillah, Why is everyone laughing?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\tMedic, Inc! Displays Decorum in Recent Response \n\n\tWhen a tanker of marshmallow spread jack-knifed on I-385 in Rosendale last Wednesday, emergency response team Medic!

A former military man, Barrier takes discipline and procedure very seriously. He even hires a detachment of bugle players ñ at a cost of $500 - to play drills that keep his medics in line. Seeing them coming through all that gooey, sugary mess with military precision and gravitas, explained one crash victim covered in marshmallow goop, almost makes you glad you're injured. Barrier's fully licensed medical and security unit had the experience to handle a very sticky situation. But they were slow as molasses, complained Joyce Quicksilver, I was stuck in my car for hours! It isn't the first time Medic! Inc. has been singled out for slow response, but Barrier chafes at that criticism, In an emergency it's not important to count the seconds, it's making sure every second counts.\n"

				"\tRetired Practitioners Respond to Local Alarm!\n\n\tWhen an alarm bell sounded at New City pet store, Pets Unlimited, last Wednesday evening, 73 year-old Dr. Zeke Mullen sprang into action. Well, it woke me up from my nap, that's for sure, recalls Dr. Mullen, The shop is right across the street from my office. Dr. Mullen is no ordinary old person, he's the owner of Mullen Medical Supply Inc., which not only sells used health care equipment, it puts them to use when emergencies strike. Hearing the call of duty, Dr. Mullen roused his rapid response team. You have to remember, this was around five in the afternoon ñ prime nap time, so it took awhile to wake everyone up, explains Dr. Mullen. Around 8:30PM, Dr. Mullen's staff of ex-retirees arrived at the pet store with $1000 worth of tarps, folding tables, tents and mosquito nets to build a triage area and another $1000 worth of bandages, rubbing alcohol, iodine, geritol and adult diapers to be prepared for the worst. They let themselves in with the key under the mat and found parakeets flying everywhere. Someone had forgot to lock their cages and they set off the motion detector, says Dr. Mullen, So we opened the door and shooed them out. Unfortunately, during the operation, several thieves walked off with rare iguanas and an ibex. The store owner blames Mullen Medics for not having any security training or common sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMechanized Transportation Enables Rapid Response\n\n\tThey call themselves the silver bullets. They're senior citizen EMTs from Mullen Medical Supply Inc. who travel on mechanized scooters- which cost $500 - to provide a rapid response to local emergencies. All over 70 years old, these semi-retired health and security professionals are led by Dr. Zeke Mullen, the celebrated physician who was once given the key to the city for his service to the community. That was a great day, recalls Dr. Mullen, still groggy from his mid-day nap, But I'm having the time of my life right now as a silver bullet! While the nickname conjures up a lightning fast reaction to a crisis, critics contend these bullets are more like silver slugs. Speedologist Dr. Spencer Gonzalez explains, A 9mm bullet can travel 1500 feet per second ñ or roughly 1023 miles per hour. The average person runs at about 6 miles an hour. These mechanized scooters top off at around 3 miles per hour ñ so you can see, the analogy is flawed. Mullen Medical's response time is even slower when you factor in their frequent naps, bathroom breaks and occasional dementia. When you do the math, remarks Gonzales, They're actually moving in reverse."

				"\tRC Boats Deployed to Contain Toxic Leak\n\n\tA burst pipe sent toxic waste spewing from a local dog food plant in Wexlerberg on Friday threatening the Himahoochie River- the city's only source for drinking water. We all know how toxic and disgusting dog food scraps are, said Wexlerberg Mayor Tucker Meinhoff, So we needed this contained fast. Meinhoff turned to toxic spill expert Peter Boltright of Premiere Containment. The Himahoochie is too small for the boats we normally use, recalls Boltright, So we decided to contain the spill with radio controlled boats. But first, that meant constructing a 200 foot tower ñ a $500 expense ñ to monitor, control and supervise the RC operation. I invented a collapsible tower, explains Boltright, So we were up and running quicker than a hobo on a ham sandwich. The RC boats were able to drag impenetrable liners, berms, pallets and booms to contain the dog food detritus at a cost of $1800. We're incredibly grateful to Boltright and his team, exclaimed Mayor Meinhoff at a press conference, They've demonstrated once again that they are the experts in river spill containment. Thanks to them, we don't have to worry about a deadly outbreak of Barkinson's disease.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\tKnown Containment Specialist Answers Questions\n\n\tWith over 2,500 patents to his name, containment specialist Peter Boltright has come under fire recently. Is he using his government contracts to clean up toxic spills as a way to fund the R&D of his own inventions? In question is $1800 for specialized remote controlled boats he designed to clean up a spill in Wexlerberg. Government monies should never, ever fund private research, declared New City councilman Rick Fist, Except in the defense, healthcare, transportation and biotech industries. And what about allegations of public displays of affection between Boltright and containment equipment? Sure his company, Premier Containment, is the leading authority on containing toxic spills in rivers and his team of crane operators, machinists and engineers can be quickly deployed to a disaster site, but he's obviously a nutty, greedy weirdo, said a passerby in downtown New City. To refute these claims, Boltright held a press conference Wednesday at his machine shop. I do love machines, admitted Boltright, but I'm not in love with them. What people saw between me and that dredger was a routine diagnostic check up. He also explained that his heart will always belong to the toxin containment process itself."

It is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch ñ a trash heap twice the size of Texas weighing over 3 million tons- all made out of plastic. We use plastic for everything, says environmentalist Jean Piece, And an awful lot of it ends up out there in a floating landfill. To figure out what can be done, a UN task force is sending noted containment specialist Oroko Nakashima and her company Running Rivers Corporation to survey this continent of crap. However, Nakshima is skeptical that her usual equipment ñ oil containment booms, liners and berms that cost $1500, and more traditional bamboo baskets, fishing lines and retrofitting for Far Eastern fishing vessels that cost $750 ñ will be enough to handle the overwhelming trash-berg. Even if containment is possible, notes Nakashima, Where do you put that much plastic? But with her reputation of being able to handle any ocean containment disaster ñ like protecting coral and mangroves from oil spills ñ the UN is hopeful Nakashima will find a way. It will be good to be back on the Ocean, says Nakashima, I'm much more experienced with the sea than with the rivers around New City. She hopes her trip will at least raise awareness and provide the world with a message in a ñ plastic ñ bottle.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tElliot County Vendor to Speak at Conference\n\n\tNext month New City will host Green Up Politics, a statewide conference on how local politicians can become more involved in environmental issues ñ or at least seem to care about them. The keynote address concerns toxic spill containment which has become a hot button issue thanks to hundreds of tragic incidents over the past few years. Our rivers have become sewers and our lakes have become toilets, complained Rosenfield Councilman Dirk Wasser, We have to take control of this problem locally! With all the emphasis on local solutions, the choice of Oroko Nakashima as the keynote speaker seems somewhat ironic. While Nakashima is undoubtedly an environmental expert and one of the most sought after containment specialists, she has never worked on a local project in the state. She's an ocean clean up rock star, says local conservationist Patti Elm, But the ocean is a thousand miles away. Nakashima's Running Rivers Corporation does have a mix of equipment to handle almost any kind of containment job, but its lack of local contacts could hinder it in an emergency. Politicians around here want to be looked up to, says Elm, Not talked down to. Nakashima could score political points with her troupe of acupuncturists and herbalist that she contracts for $500 on every job. Politicians like to know up front when they'll be stabbed in the back."

If we could kill waste with bullets and grenades, we would. The former Marines are working to parlay their extensive hazardous waste cleanup experience acquired in the military into a successful business. This military background doesn't just inform their attitudes, it shapes their tactics, which include using decommissioned military spill containment equipment, at a cost of $1500 to maintain and service, and $700 worth of military-grade tent assemblies, motion detectors, and electrified chicken wire for on-site their onsite command center. The Burells have executed a number of deployments around the globe, but they insist they are a local company eager to attack regional challenges with their famous jarhead zeal. Though their experience doesn't include containing an oil spill in a river setting, the brothers say they are at the ready, should New City River need a cleanup. We haven't cleaned a river, but we burned one once, which is kind of the same thing, Bill commented, to which Phil added, without a hint of irony, We were aiming for a bad guy in a canoe and we ended up frying everything all the way to the ocean. Live and learn, right? Anyway, the guy didn't know what hit himóa fact that merited a fist bump from brother Bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMilitary-Style Discipline at the Scene of Disaster\n\n\tWhen a landside destroyed a pesticide factory in Mesoamerica, local authorities were overwhelmed with the task of containing hazardous materials.

They had personnel storming the beach from amphibious troop carriers. Which scared the heck out our tourists. Maybe it was little much, given that the spill is forty miles from the coast. Highly educated in the logistics and practices of spill containment, the brothers bring years of military experience to the hazmat business, not to mention years-old, even outdated, semi-serviceable decommissioned military equipment, which some say isn't sufficient to prevent cross-contamination. But if wars and waste cleanup can be won with sheer military grit and efficiency, the Burells and their team of former military waste wasters, as they call them, could conquer the world. Flown in by leveraging military transport connection, the Burells' army of hazmat warriors work with extraordinary precision to take out the enemy of waste. And while transport is cheap, the Burells spend $500 on Video games, DVDs, and informative industrial shorts to entertain its off-duty personnel in the ërec tent' between shifts. Whatever works, says Governor Rhine, as long as they leave."

But his victory dance was cut short when he noticed that the fish had six eyes, a few extra fins and something resembling a moustache. I thought I had me a natural wonder, said Vorme, but it turned out to be a freak of nature. It tasted pretty weird, too. Other oddities have been pulled from the lake, including dozens of similar fish and something resembling a cross between a frog and a centipede. Signs of the impending apocalypse, or just more evidence that the recent hazardous waste clean by Interstate Containment was only semi-successful? Anthony Wexler, founder of Interstate, favors the former possibility. We cleaned that lake, he insists, adding, Maybe we are at the End of Times, but folks should know I had nothing to do with it. Many area residents think otherwise, noting that Wexler used some extremely odd, out of date equipment for his cleanup work, and appeared to be quite uninformed in methods of containing and preventing hazardous spills. He is known to purchase containment and transportation equipment at online auctions, spending $1000. And records show that Wexler charged $1500 for corrugated cardboard, a square mile of netting, and a shipping container filled with high-quality chicken wireósupplies not normally associated with waste cleanup. His record also speaks for itself; past successes are all attributed to his extraordinary luck, and disasters tend to crop up after his cleanup efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGreen Rivers Alliance to Award Local Vendor!\n\n\tDart enthusiast and local entrepreneur Anthony Wexler was honored today by the Green Rivers Alliance for his charitable contributions. The move was questioned by some who point out that Wexler's attempts at providing hazardous waste containment have often lead to new and unexpected disasters. Look, his head might be in the clouds, but his heart is in the right place, explained Drew Ablanc, Awards Committee Chair for the Green River Alliance. That's why we chose to honor him with our ëGuy That Gives a Damn' award. The award comes in the form of a large trophy, depicting a bald, anatomically incorrect man with a raised fist. Wow. The Our Lady of Guancomo statue on my dashboard just got demoted, Wexler announced upon being handed the award. Included with the award is a cash prize of $1000, and though it's common practice to donate the check to charity, Wexler indicated that he would be holding on to it by folding the giant check into a small, thick cube and stuffing it into his pocket. It's assumed that the money will be used to pay the local bar owners who have disclosed the names of dart league participates that Wexler mobilizes for containment efforts."

The good news? It's fairly contained between the jetties and we have yet to see a fish with fifteen eyes or a dolphin with fingers. With that statement, the inspiring and well-spoken Wailer once again found a way to be clear, concise and comforting, even humorous, when delivering difficult newsóa comfort to area residents eager to see results. Wailer has already brought in cutting-edge technology that will allow him to measure sinkage, spread and cross-contamination at the spill site, in addition to monitoring devices for measuring and reporting ecological damage and contamination at a cost of $1800. Also in play are his famously inventive maintenance tactics, which involve $500 of duct tape, chewing gum and copper wiring for spot equipment repairs. When asked how the clean-up will work, Wailer paused a moment before responding. Snapping his fingers, he called one of his crew up to the podium and ordered him to take off his sunglasses. Pretend the redness in this man's eyes are the toxic elements, he suggested. Removing a small bottle from his pocket, he tipped back the team member's head and gently placed a few drops in each eye. The organic, non-toxic chemicals we will use in the water will breakdown the toxicity and cause the elements to dissipate into the water, like the redness in my friend's eyes. Indeed, the redness was gone and so were any doubts about Wailer's abilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOverworked Consultant Turns to Unusual Places\n\n\tWhen stressed and overworked, some seek out massages. Others play golf, read books, hunt neighborhood cats. But for the Busiest Man in the Environmental Consulting Biz, there's no substitute for soothing reggae music, organic fruits and the solitude of custom built sensory-deprivation chamber. It's the closest thing to climbing back into the womb, explains Nathaniel Wailer, an environmental expert in high demand. You float in a lightless, soundless void and, after a while, you can almost hear mother breathing around you. It sure beats TV, mon.  Unconventional, certainly, but it seems to work. Despite his 80-hour work weeks, the Montogan native always appears refreshed, cool-headed and infused with Island-style optimism. With his expertise in using cutting-edge technology that allows him to measure sinkage, spread and cross-contamination at spill sites, he has built a reputation as a leading field consultant and clean-up specialist. Some find his tactics a bit unconventionalólike the $500 expense associated with having organic fruits, vegetables and sugar-free candies available to assessment personnel, or his eccentric, handy-man approach to maintaining equipment with duct tape and chewing gum. But everyone agrees always he delivers in high fashion. Could sensory-deprivation be the key to his success? Maybe, he ponders. But it could also have to do with the fact that I meditate every day."

He executed a textbook cleanup and restored services, not to mention confidence in workers. Yet, Jannis Economou, the jet-setting, highly successful environmental assessment consultant, let down at least one Statewide employee. He was just so disappointing, said Keisa Tode, a Project Manager at the plant. Sure, he was great with the hazardous waste and everything, but he had such a nice, young voice on the phone and so I wasn't expecting a such a gross middle-aged man.  I mean, he's balding, for crying out loud.  And, what's up with all that jewelry? What is this, 1975? A kinder reading of the many gold necklaces could be that they signal the aging playboy's many successes. After all, Economou's company, Ypoforo Ecosystems has a hard-earned reputation for being a provider of fully independent, peer-reviewed, accurate and unbiased reports. The company has up-to-date training and equipment to successfully monitor the New City River ecosystem, charging $2000 for its on-site assessment staff and administrators to man the command and control center. Economou's many high profile clients around the world would certainly attest to the quality of his work. I wish some of these high profile clients would have called ahead and attested to his ickiness, said Keisa. OMG, I just got a horrible mental picture of him in a Speedo! Eww, eww, eww.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEnvrionmental Consultant Called to Reappear Before Committee\n\n\tHe first appeared before the committee last Friday, but the only consensus his visit produced was unanimous confusion. Mr. Economou has a way of speaking that resembles his manner of wearing jewelry, says Committee Chair Ben Thardondat, referencing the aging playboy environmentalist's many layers of gold chain necklaces. That is, overly ornamental and hopelessly entangled. Now the committee has reluctantly invited Economou back, urging him to give a more conventional report of his company's recent analysis of New City river, as well as an explanation for the $2000 fee attributed to onsite staff and administrators to man command and control center. Economou's first presentation confirmed the widely held impression that he can occasionally be disorganized and unruly in appearance, and sometimes has a hard time clearly and concisely communicating his findings. Indeed, the amateur classicist's report resembled the recitation of a poorly written epic poem. The sons of our city in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a council man by man, Economou began his report, continuing with, but not to cry the matter aloud; I made haste also myself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly. Why didn't committee members ask for clarification on the spot? It sounded good, explains Thardondat, and no one wanted to look like an idiot. It took us a few days to decide who the real idiot is. Mr. Economou will reappear this Wednesday."

				"\tGrayville Eddy Declared Clean!\n\n\tEnvironmental advocate Ramblin' Rose has declared Grayville Eddy clean after an assessment of the Eddy's waters. At an unconventional press conference, Rose gave the water quality in the Eddy a 21-peace sign salute, before launching into a 15-minute air guitar solo. That water's clean as tears from a baby angel, Rose proclaimed.  To demonstrate the water's purity, Rose waded into the Eddy to take a long drink. That's just one way I stand by my assessments, explained the area's leading advocateóa woman known not to give in to the demands of the man and who prides herself of producing fully independent and accurate findings. The event ended with Rose and her followersóa tie-dye clad team of bus-ins who are often seen at environmental disaster sitesópacking up Rose's psychedelic earth bus and driving off into the sunset. However, some are now wishing she had stuck around, believing she could offer an explanation for why biodiversity in the waterway has plummeted since her assessment. Park Manager Justin Thyme suspects that organic compounds found in the tie-dye colorants worn by Rose's team now may be functioning as contaminants in the waterway. The colorants, inks and three dozen white t-shirts and work pants used to create tie-dyed uniforms were already a disputed line item on Rose's invoice. Now it seems the true cost of groovy goes well beyond the $500 expense. Tie-dye? More like tie-dead, Thyme says. Rose could not be reached for comment; she is presently being hospitalized for a stomach ailment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLocal Activist's Report Makes a Stand!\n\n\tMother Earth ain't a pushover, says Ramblin' Rose, the environmental advocate who recently declared the Grayville Eddy waterways uncontaminated after a series of tests. Humans try to harsh her mellow but she's bigger than that. The conclusion came as a surprise to members of the waterway community who believed something was amiss in the Eddy after spotting a slew of dead fish along the banks, as well as a raccoon with five eyes. They put out a call for help and Ramblin' Rose answered. By tapping her enormous network of supporters and fans of the 90's jam band The Boys, she was able to quickly assemble an assessment team. She raised some eyebrows when she demanded $500 worth of inks, colorants and three dozen white t-shirts and work pants to create tie-dyed uniforms for assessment personnel.  She also used equipment purchased from online auction houses, which has led to dubious results in the past. But her colorful crew ran a battery of tests to the sounds of Boys bootleg tapes, broadcast via loudspeaker from Rose's earth bus. Local corporations suspected of dumping contaminants into the waterway were pleased with the findings, leading some to wonder if Rose had been bought off. Don't even go there, Rose warned. And what about the five-eyed raccoon? Just Mother Nature being creative, Rose offered with a shrug. I've been with plenty of people whose features some might call, well, unnaturalóbut I call blessed."

They rode in blasting a punked-out version of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and ran over a lot kids and their parents. While the number of injuries is disputed, it's clear that the consultants, led by environmentalist Skeeter McBragg, were excessively vigorous in their efforts to determine the environmental status of the playground. This level of aggression is absolutely necessary, according to McBragg, who explains that you got to fight fire with fire when dealing with these sleazebag corporations, even if that means grinding on the occasional toddler and her nanny, and their poodle.  And with Enviro-X's playground assessment completed, McBragg's famous one-sided contempt for Elliot Counties biggest corporations has a new target: the nearby design firm Webtastic are being labeled polluters and contaminators by an enraged McBragg, whose company slogan is Make ëem pay. The firm denies any wrongdoing. Company Spokesperson Ella Menopea states that, McBragg is misguided to say the least. We don't produce biological waste. We design websites and it's not like we secretly bury toxic unused pixels in the playground at night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLocal Activist Given Key to the City!\n\n\tNew City leaders honored local legend environmentalist and skater Skeeter McBragg for his firm's efforts in cleaning up the New City waterfront. McBragg, whose company Enviro-X is comprised of skater activists, hoisted the key over his head to a roar of applause from his youthful followers. It was clearly a moment of comeuppance for a man whose unconventional tactics have plagued his efforts to be taken seriously as a legitimate protector of the area's environment. Such questionable tactics include a $1000 on-site command areas consisting of a card table and half-pipe and assessment presentations that are more profane rants that they are statistical reports. A known crusader, McBragg is has been accused of strategies more often associated with eco-terrorists than advocates. His verbal attacks are known for their total lack of scientifically acquired evidence, not to mention reason, nor complete sentences. Yet all this seemed to be water under the bridge, so to speak, as McBragg's efforts were officially recognized by New City officials. I'm proud to present this tireless advocate with the key to the city, announced Councilman Will Hustop. That's a big-ass key, McBragg exclaimed, marveling at the prop before adding, so where's the door to the city? The line earned laughter from all assembledólaughter that was quickly silenced when a frowning McBragg asked, No. Seriously. Where am I supposed to use this thing?"

			{"Wes Berlin",
				"\tAnglophile Activist Pays for Accent\n\n\tA man purporting to be the former accent-coach for punk activist Wes Berlin has gone public with his wrongful termination case against the singer. The claim, which was filed this week, states that the accent coach, Mr. M. Tarde, was fired by Berlin when the singer learned that Mr. Tarde was not authentically English. Rather, Mr. Tarde hails from our very own Elliot County and has never set foot in the United Kingdom. Berlin, who paid $2350 for coaching intended to refine his fake English accent, learned of Mr. Tarde's deception when the tutor let loose with a long stream of curses in perfect American English, after sitting on Berlin's spiked dog collar. It was like the geezer was bloody possessed, explains Berlin. And possessed by a Yank sailor. Mr. Tarde insists he's entitled to damages due to the fact that his accent coach was not only truly English, but a person with direct ties to England's punk royaltyóthe seminal band Joy Division. I was providing Mr. Berlin with insider instruction, resulting in an impeccable approximation of mid-70's, West London, punk dialect, claims Tarde. He was fooling everyone. On the contrary, it seems no one was fooled, but no one cared either. Well-spoken and witty, Berlin's ability to improvise brilliant responses to the press overshadowed his rather clunky Cockney accent. I guess you get what you pay for, Berlin recently admitted, dropping his pose. A fake British accent from a fake British dude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDiary Reveals Punk Legend's Sensitive Side\n\n\tWith the rise in popularity of Wes Berlin, punk legend turned social activist, artifacts from his early, wilder days have popped up everywhere. There's the now-famous picture of him breaking a guitar over a security guard's head and giving a music critic the business end of his Doc Marten after an unkind CD review. And how about the tour bus recording of Berlin screaming at groupies for waking him up? Then there's the latest item to appear in an online auction: the singer's teen diary, in which he reveals a desire to become a veterinarian, a secret love for musicals and an undying affection for sea otters. Huh? Yes, apparently, Berlin wasn't always the radical punk warrior he is today, though, even now, one can see evidence that Berlin still retains some of that earlier sensitivity. There's his famous love for his mother, which is most evident in the mum tattoo inked into his chest. His love for sea mammals is revealed in the giant $1000 tattoo commemorating the baby seals that were, according to Berlin, lost in the New City oil spill. And perhaps most telling is his ongoing display of a deep-rooted understanding of the area's many complex environmental issues, not to mention his well stated and witty improvised responses to queries from the media. Some fans have argued that the diary is a fake, but Berlin recently confirmed its authenticity by flashing yet another, ill-placed tattoo at reportersóa tattoo of a sea otter in a leather jacket."

The two males stormed in wearing Halloween masks of deceased rap stars Jokey Joke and DJ Kopeck, leading authorities to believe they are likely members of the newfound inner-city crime, We Be Loot'n. The Buck and Change night shift cashier activated the store's alarm moments after the two men fled. First to respond was Force One CEO and flamboyant freelance crime fighter Cedric Maxwell, who is said to have spent $2,150 on police scanners, surveillance equipment and klieg lights to alert Force One members of emerging situations. After radioing fellow martial arts experts Jude O'Chop and Brick Striker, whose league support has enabled his firm to handle most crisis relief scenarios, the three closed in on the perimeter and cornered the thugs in the alley behind Magnet Universe. A very, very brief altercation ensued before patrol cars arrived and arrested the two men, who had made off with six dollars in quarters as well as several bags of paper plates and coasters. Maxwell, known more as a wanna-be action hero than a buttoned-up logistics provider, told the New City Gazette, I exist in the alleys, in the cracks of the pavement, perched atop traffic lights and under the floorboards.

While Maxwell is known for resorting to extreme measures to protect the interests of his logistics firm's offerings and recently put together a network of karate schools to aid in the transportation of relief supplies, he is better known for his prowess and abilities in the world of martial arts. After distributing the weaponry, Maxwell made his first attempt ever at karate chopping a full-sized SUV in two, but was forced to cease and desist when his friend and co-worker, Brick Striker, president of the New City Nubian Ninja Squad, got wind of a string of burglaries on the southern side of Cassady Canyon.

PSG, the master logistics practitioners with an infrastructure said to be suited for any and every crisis relief scenario, showed First Pick as well as the New City restaurant community exactly why their reputation remains top drawer. Slice of Beef, manager James Burger elaborates, I've never seen anyone take toothpicking so seriously. The trucks were flanked by patrol cars and three helicopters. When they arrived, the PSG employees were accompanied by police officers in riot gear. I was like, ëokay,' but even if their operation is kind of overkill, you have to hand it Wong, that lady runs a sophisticated outfit. PSG employees arrived dressed in sparkling new uniforms and company hats, which ran the company a sum of $2,350 and brandished two-way radios, constantly speaking in code. Burger says, They even set up all the dispensers and handed out toothpicks to patrons. It was a little much, but who can complain? After the daylong distribution, the excess toothpicks were transferred to local PSG warehouses, where they remain under twenty-four-hour armed guard.

Still, the lawsuits are piling up just as fast as the company's invoices. Counsel for the plaintiffs, Rob Ensue, delivered the following statement to the press: Margaret Wong is so passive aggressive and controlling that many of her employees regularly suffer from nervous breakdowns. When asked if PSG's $1,000 in-company team of psychologists wasn't instated for this very reason, Ensue got down to brass tacks. Look. None of these headshrinkers and psychobabblers know what they're dealing with. I've got a client who can't sleep at night, and every time she shifts in bed, whispers, ëPerhaps I should consider reprioritizing my angular habits for the sake of efficacious slumber.'

Rown charges clients $1000 for a small tent, suntan lotion, chaise lounge chairs and palm fronds that are used to fan her while she supervises the clean-up. She also sports colorful costumes ñ in this case, a ruby encrusted jumpsuit that made her look like a ketchup splashed jewel. The world's most dangerous toxin, explains Rown, Is being dull. That attitude has created problems for Rown in the past. Many have suggested that she over-dramatizes situations in order to drive up her prices.

Many of the volunteer persons were, according to the suit, Inadequately trained for an emergency situation of this nature. Baum spent $2,000 to transport his personnel, including interns and trainees.  The attorney for the plaintiff's is Mark Marx. He states further that Baum put at risk dozens of people. The incident occurred last year when a truck loaded with toxic waste collided with a circus train. There were wild animals, snakes, lions, and elephants everywhere said Marx. Not everyone has the tolerance or immunity claimed by Baum, he continued. In defense of Baum, the local sheriff said, It was a crazy moment. Luckily the circus people tended to the animals. Baum, though, secured several damaged drums filled with hazardous materials It was twenty minutes before our own Hazardous Waste Units were on the scene, Baum could not be reached for comment but his self-described right hand man Reilly Volved said that, Adam is not going to respond with a statement for the press. He is a conservationist and did the right thing that day. There was trouble and he contributed to solving the emergency. He would never expect volunteers or employees to put their lives at risk.

My command of statute law is much greater than my command of the required rhetoric of many provincial minds. The invincible nature of my arguments is not as easy as to impugn my eloquence skills. No one doubts the depth of Singh's memory and skills as a researcher. He is a problem when it comes to filing. Understanding what he says, though, can be a lot of work, said a bailiff from a New City court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tIS SINGH'S GURU ALSO A CRIMINAL?\n\n\tIt was reported that Avanish Singh had employed a personal guru to aid him with decision-making and health enhancement techniques for relaxation and stress reduction. But is this guru, Pradesh Ohnvools qualified in another area? Ohnvools was hired for $1,000 to perform personal services and guide techniques for better health for the attorney. However, investigative members of the County Office on Suspicious Characters has found that Ohnvools might have had a different identity in a former incarnation. We have discovered that an illegal immigrant who went by the name Pradish Sloovnho had been detected up-state. He was connected to shady activities in a money laundering scheme, revealed Detective Finditt. The funneling of monies to criminal organizations is a Federal crime, he reminded. If the young lawyer has inadvertently employed a criminal, he will not be held legally responsible. However, this possibility brings again to the public forum more evidence that the successful young attorney is in need of much more experience. He may be a winner, but is it really skill? I think luck may play a bigger role in Singh's legal victories than many are willing to admit, confided a competing attorney of Singh's high-profile reputation.  The fact that Eastern Legal has seen a rapid rise in reputation has been attributed to the skill of Avanish Singh's attention to detail and his fantastic memory, recalling even the seemingly most insignificant of facts."

				"\tLAWYERS SUE CITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CARELESSNESS\n\n\tThe firm of Dewey, Sewham, and Howe recently filed suit against New City. The grounds of the suit are that the doors on the Senior Center are unnecessarily over-large. This is in conflict with green guidelines adopted by the city council earlier this year. When the doors open automatically, valuable cooling or heating is lost, as these patrons move very slowly. Citing this as architectural irresponsibility the firm has sued on behalf of the school district. The District Attorney's Office has stated that they plan to file against the firm with Bar Commission. Dewey and his cronies are using media advertising hoping to gain support for their suit by appealing to greed and short-sightedness, asserted an assistant District Attorney. The firm has budgeted some $2,150 for a media blitz on local radio and television stations. The ads will also include a lure for persons affected by last year's toxic waste spill, as well. We at D,S,&H have become experts at exploiting government incompetence. We see it as our constitutional duty to be a watch-dog for the environment. says Boyd Dewey, the firm's senior attorney.  There are those in the community who see D,S,&H as thieves who leech away important tax dollars for their personal gain. Three previous lawsuits have netted the lawyers thousands of dollars that was neither given to their clients, nor contributed to environmental works. Anytime this firm is involved, you can be certain that they will guard their own profit first. Does the concept of robbery mean anything to you? This source prefers to remain unidentified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHEROES AND VILLIANS: DEWEY, SEWHAM, AND HOWE\n\n\tOne moment the partners seem to have compassion for the little guy and the underdog. The next they are predators, taking advantage of the naÔve, the uneducated, the victims. At a recent mixer to encourage New City businesses to make all planned upgrades environmentally friendly, Gordon Dewey was a featured speaker. His theme was Making Modest Progress Through Modest Choices. The concept is based on the best-selling book by Indian environmentalist Dunno Wattamtawkinbouthi. To be green is to be thoughtful, to demand less, to expect less, Dewey offered by-way-of clarification. The talk was well received. However, knowing that Dewey's firm financed his very expensive Italian shoes and embroidered ties, it was difficult for some to take the attorney seriously. I know that his firm authorized expenditures of $1,000 and more for tasteful enhancements. Boyd feels that he must be as fashionable as any modern leader of the community, revealed Jim Dandy, local haberdasher. Some suggest that these enhancements are at the expense of clients who are indebted to Dewey, Sewham, and Howe. There are reportedly hundreds of people making payments to the firm, some for as many as sixty-months.  said Judge Meenow, They are reaping the rewards of being both successful and canny. Peers contend that most of that firm's wins are based on technicalities, tiny mistakes made by the opposition or in the appeals process. An unnamed attorney said, These guys are hypocrites, little more than ambulance chasers with a great line."

				"\tSTAFFING SCANDAL REVEALED:\n\tATTORNEY ADMITS HAVING A MANICURIST ON PAYROLL\n\t\n\tIn an unprecedented admission, Abbie S.Korpis, renowned attorney and environmentalist, has confirmed that she has a part-time manicurist on her office payroll. I need to be in top form at all times laughed the famous lawyer. I could never feel that I'm at my best with a broken or chipped nail. The problem is that the manicurist is paid $4,250 for her services. This revelation has shaken the foundation of the local bar association. We of the bar are astounded that one attorney could be so vain and irresponsible, said Boyd Dewey, senior partner of the famous law firm of Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe. Public perception and stereotypes are reinforced by bad judgement like this, he continued.  It is no secret that Korpis spends enormously on her wardrobe. A recent financial statement revealing an expenditure of $2,000 for fashion accessories was made public recently. I don't see why it's so scandalous for a woman to take pride in her appearance. Men wear expensive tailored suits but they all look alike. My wardrobe changes with each event, each public appearance. It's a professional obligation for me to create an impression. A woman with graying hair and red suspenders does not have the same effect as a man with those characteristics. Korpis, no doubt, has a point. Her intense but competent presentations have figured heavily in her many legal victories."

				"\tKORPIS CHARGES GATES WITH ODD BEHAVIOR \n\n\tAbbie Korpis, representing New City in a lawsuit against Goliath Corporation charged today that Goliath's legal council was unstable and under the influence of a cult leader. Goliath's lawyer, Liddy Gates, said the personal attack was simply a tactic to sway the jury before it was seated. Abbie is just worried that she's about to lose a significant case. Asked about the veracity of the facts, Gates responded, I pay a significant amount of money for therapy.  I, like Avanish Singh and other individuals, have a spiritual counselor.  Of course, my advisor Korla Pandit is not under suspicion of any criminal activity. As far as my therapy goes, it demonstrates my sincere commitment to the principles of law and the dedicated focus I have for my clients. Like an athlete, I train to be in top form at all times. It's my mind and spirit that are in prime shape. Known for her dramatic presentation and histrionics, Gates is nonetheless a major force in the law. She has never been known to lose a case. Her track record is amazing, cites LaWanda Sewham, of Dewey, Sewham, and Howe. I wish we could talk her into joining our firm. Meanwhile, Korpis remains unimpressed. Liddy is unstable and my advice to her clients is to find another lawyer. There is cheaper and better representation in New City she said, all the while smiling. Of course, warned Gates, if Ms.Korpis continues with this slanderous talk, we will have a little sit-down, just the two of us."
